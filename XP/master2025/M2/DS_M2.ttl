Project : Students should form groups of 2-4 members. A list of candidate papers will be posted, and each group should pick one from the list. Each group is required to give an oral presentation about the content of the paper in the last two weeks, and submit a report at the end. The report should include at the minimum a summary of the method/framework, and experimental results obtained by playing the code published along with the paper. Division of work should be determined by the members.
