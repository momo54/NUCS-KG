Selecting appropriate computational solutions to real-world problems\nbenefits from understanding the theoretical and practical capabilities and limitations of available\nalgorithms and paradigms, including their impact on the environment and society. Moreover, this\nunderstanding provides insight into the intrinsic nature of computation, computational problems, and\ncomputational problem-solving as well as possible solution techniques independent of programming\nlanguage, programming paradigm, computer hardware, or other implementation aspects.\nThis knowledge area focuses on the nature of computation including the concepts and skills required to\ndesign and analyze algorithms for solving real-world computational problems. It complements the\nimplementation of algorithms and data structures found in the Software Development Foundations\n(SDF) knowledge area. As algorithms and data structures are essential in all advanced areas of\ncomputer science, this area provides the algorithmic foundations that every computer science graduate\nis expected to know. Exposure to the breadth of these foundational AL topics is designed to provide\nstudents with the basis for studying these topics in more depth, for studying additional computation and\nalgorithm topics, and for learning advanced algorithms across a variety of CS knowledge areas and\nCS+X disciplines.\nChanges since CS2013\nThis area has been renamed from Algorithms and Complexity to better reflect its foundational scope\nsince topics in this area focus on the practical and theoretical foundations of algorithms, complexity,\nand computability. These topics also provide the foundational prerequisites for advanced study in\ncomputer science. Additionally, topics focused on complexity and computability have been cleanly\nseparated into respective knowledge units. To reinforce the important impact of computation on society,\na Society, Ethics, and the Profession (AL-SEP) knowledge unit has been added with the expectation\nthat SEP implications be addressed in some manner during every lecture hour of focus in this AL\nknowledge area.\nThe increase of four CS Core hours acknowledges the importance of this foundational area in the CS\ncurriculum and returns it to the 2001 level (less than one course). Despite this increase, there is a\nsignificant overlap in hours with the Software Development Fundamentals (SDF) and Mathematical\nFoundations (MSF) areas. There is also a complementary nature of the units in this area since, for\nexample, while linear search of an array covers topics in AL-Foundational, it can be used to\nsimultaneously explain AL-Complexity O(n) and AL-Strategies Brute-Force topics.\nThe KA topics and hours primarily reflect topics studied in a stand-alone computational theory course\nand the availability of additional hours when such a course is included in the curriculum.\n87\nCore Hours\nKnowledge Unit CS Core KA Core\nFoundational Data Structures and Algorithms 11 6\nAlgorithmic Strategies 6\nComplexity Analysis 6 3\nComputational Models and Formal Languages 9 23\nSociety, Ethics, and the Profession Included in SEP hours\nTotal 32 32\nThe 11 CS Core hours in Foundational Data Structures and Algorithms are in addition to 9\nhours counted in SDF and 3 hours counted in MSF.\nKnowledge Units"

Alternatively, in the four-course\napproach, the AL-Model knowledge unit CS and KA Core topics are addressed in a Computational\nTheory focused course, which leaves room to address additional KA topics in the third Algorithms\ncourse. Both approaches assume Big-O analysis is introduced in the Data Structures (CS2) course and\nthat graphs are taught in the third Algorithms course. The committee recognizes that there are many\ndifferent approaches for packaging AL topics into courses including, for example, introducing graphs in\nCS2 Data Structures, backtracking in an AI course, and AL-Model topics in a theory course that also\naddresses, for instance, FPL topics.

As the shift from sequential to parallel processing occurs, a deeper understanding\nof the underlying computer architectures is necessary. Architecture can no longer be viewed as a black\nbox where principles from one architecture can be applied to another. Instead, programmers should look\ninside the black box and use specific components to enhance system performance and energy efficiency.\nThe Architecture and Organization (AR) knowledge area aims to develop a deeper understanding of the\nhardware environments upon which almost all computing is based, and the relevant interfaces provided\nto higher software layers. The target hardware comprises low-end embedded system processors up to\nhigh-end enterprise multiprocessors.\nThe topics in this knowledge area will benefit students by enabling them to appreciate the fundamental\narchitectural principles of modern computer systems, including the challenge of harnessing parallelism\nto sustain performance and energy improvements into the future. This KA will help computer science\nstudents depart from the black box approach and become more aware of the underlying computer system\nand the efficiencies specific architectures can achieve.\nChanges since CS2013\nChanges and additions are summarized as follows.\n● Topics have been revised, particularly AR/Memory Hierarchy and AR/Performance and Energy\nEfficiency. This update brings recent advances in memory caching and energy consumption.\n● The newly created AR/Heterogeneous Architectures covers emerging topics in Computer\nArchitecture: Processing In-Memory (PIM) and domain-specific architectures (e.g., neural\nnetwork processors).\n● The new AR/Quantum Architectures offers a \"toolbox\" covering introductory topics in quantum\ncomputing.\n● Knowledge units have been merged to better deal with overlaps:\n● AR/Multiprocessing and Alternative Architectures were merged into newly created\nAR/Heterogeneous Architectures.\n● The new AR/Secure Processor Architectures covers hardware support for multi-stack security\napplications.\nCore Hours\nKnowledge Unit CS Core KA Core\nDigital Logic and Digital Systems 2 + 1 (SF)\n101\nMachine-Level Data Representation 1\nAssembly Level Machine Organization 1 1 + 1 (PDC)\nMemory Hierarchy 4+2 (OS)\nInterfacing and Communication 1\nFunctional Organization 2\nPerformance and Energy Efficiency 3\nHeterogeneous Architectures 2\nSecure Processor Architectures 2\nQuantum Architectures 2\nSustainability Issues Included in SEP hours\nTotal 9 16\nThe hours shared with OS include overlapping topics and are counted here.\nKnowledge Units"

Anderson, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA\n● Qiao Xiang, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China\n● Adrian German, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA\n111\n112\nData Management (DM)\nPreamble\nSince the mid-1970s, the study of Data Management (DM) has meant an almost exclusive study of\nrelational database systems. Depending on institutional context, students have studied, in varying\nproportions, the following.\n• Data modeling and database design: for example, E-R Data model, relational model,\nnormalization theory\n• Query construction: e.g., relational algebra, SQL\n• Query processing: e.g., indices (B+tree, hash), algorithms (e.g., external sorting, select, project,\njoin), query optimization (transformations, index selection)\n• DBMS internals: e.g., concurrency/locking, transaction management, buffer management\nToday's graduates are expected to possess DBMS user (rather than implementor) skills. These\nprimarily include data modeling and query construction; ability to take an unorganized collection of data,\norganize it using a DBMS, and access/update the collection via queries.\nAdditionally, students need to study the following.\n● The role data plays in an organization. This includes the Data Life Cycle: Creation-Processing-\nReview/Reporting-Retention/Retrieval-Destruction.\n● The social/legal aspects of data collection: e.g., scale, data privacy, database privacy (compliance)\nby design, de-identification, ownership, reliability, database security, and intended and unintended\napplications.\n● Emerging and advanced technologies that are augmenting/replacing traditional relational systems,\nparticularly those used to support (big) data analytics, including NoSQL (e.g., JSON, XML, key-\nvalue store databases), cloud databases, MapReduce, and dataframes.\n● The existing and emerging roles for those involved with data management, which include the\nfollowing.\no Product feature engineers: those who use both SQL and NoSQL operational databases.\no Analytical engineers/data engineers: those who write analytical SQL, Python, and Scala\ncode to build data assets for business groups.\no Business analysts: those who build/manage data most frequently with Excel spreadsheets.\no Data infrastructure engineers: those who implement a data management system in a variety\nof data applications (e.g., OLTP).\no “Everyone” who produces or consumes data must understand the associated social, ethical,\nand professional issues.\nOne role that transcends all the above categories is that of data custodian. Previously, data were seen\nas a resource to be managed (Information Systems Management) just like other enterprise resources.\nToday, data are seen in a larger context. Data about customers can now be seen as belonging to (or in\nsome national contexts, as owned by) those customers. There is now an accepted understanding that\nthe safe and ethical storage, and use, of institutional data is part of being a responsible data custodian.\n113\nFurthermore, we acknowledge the tension between a curricular focus on professional preparation\nversus the study of a knowledge area as a scientific endeavor. This is particularly true with Data\nManagement. For example, proving (or at least knowing) the completeness of Armstrong’s Axioms is\nfundamental in functional dependency theory. However, most computer science graduates will never\nutilize this concept during their professional careers. The same can be said for many other topics in the\nData Management canon. Conversely, if our graduates can only normalize data into Boyce-Codd\nnormal form (using an automated tool) and write SQL queries, without understanding the role that\nindices play in efficient query execution, we have done them and society a disservice.\nTo this end, the number of CS Core hours is relatively small relative to the KA Core hours. This\napproach is designed to allow institutions with differing contexts to customize their curricula\nappropriately. An institution that focuses on OLTP implementation, for example, would prioritize efficient\nstorage and data access, while an institution that focuses on product features would prioritize\nprogrammatic access to extant databases.\nHowever, an institution manages this tension, we wish to give voice to one of the ironies of computer\nscience curricula. Students typically spend much of their educational life reading (and writing) data from\na file or interactively, while outside of the academy the predominant data comes from databases\naccessed programmatically. Perhaps in the not-too-distant future students will learn programmatic\ndatabase access early on and then continue this practice as they progress through their curriculum.\nFinally, we understand that while the Data Management KA may be orthogonal to the SEC (Security)\nand SEP (Society, Ethics, and the Profession) KAs, it is also ground zero for these (and other)\nknowledge areas. When designing persistent data stores, the question of what should be stored must\nbe examined from both legal and ethical perspectives. Are there privacy concerns? And just as\nimportantly, how well protected is the data?\nChanges since CS2013\n● Rename the knowledge area from Information Management to Data Management. This\nrenaming does not represent any kind of philosophical shift. It is simply an effort to avoid\nconfusion with the similar definitions used in Information Systems and Information Technology\ncurricula.\n● Inclusion of NoSQL approaches and MapReduce as CS Core topics.\n● Increased attention to SEP and SEC topics in both the CS Core and KA Core areas.\nCore Hours\nKnowledge Unit CS Core Hours KA Core Hours\nThe Role of Data 2\nCore Database Systems Concepts 2 1\n114\nData Modeling 2 3\nRelational Databases 1 3\nQuery Construction 2 4\nQuery Processing 4\nDBMS Internals 4\nNoSQL Systems 2\nData Security & Privacy 1 2\nData Analytics 3\nDistributed Databases/Cloud Computing\nSemi-structured and Unstructured Databases\nSociety, Ethics, and the Profession Included in SEP hours\nTotal 10 26\nThe CS Core hour in Data Security & Privacy is shared with SEC and is counted here.\nKnowledge Units"

As\ndescribed in [1], there are four primary perspectives from which to approach databases:\n● Database design/modeling\n● Database use\n● Database administration\n● Database development, which includes implementation algorithms\nCourse design proceeds by focusing on topics from each perspective in varying degrees according to\none’s institutional context. For example, in [1], one of the courses described can be characterized as\ndesign/modeling (20%), use (20%), development/internals (30%), and administration/tuning/advanced\ntopics (30%). The topics might include the following.\n● DM-SEP (3 hours)\n● DM-Data (1 hour)\n● DM-Core (3 hours)\n● DM-Modeling (5 hours)\n● DM-Relational (4 hours)\n● DM-Querying (6 hours)\n● DM-Processing (5 hours)\n● DM-Internals (5 hours)\n● DM-NoSQL (4 hours)\n● DM-Security (3 hours)\n124\n● DM-Distributed (2 hours)\nThe more interesting question may be how to cover the CS Core concepts in the absence of a\ndedicated database course. The key to accomplishing this may be to normalize database access.\nStarting with the introductory course, students could access a database instead of using file I/O or\ninteractive data entry to acquire the data needed for introductory-level programming. As students\nprogress through their curriculum, additional CS Core topics could be introduced. For example,\nintroductory students could be given the code to access the database along with the SQL query. At the\nintermediate level, they could be writing their own queries. Finally, in a Software Engineering or\ncapstone course, they could practice database design. One advantage of this approach, databases\nacross the curriculum, is that it allows for the inclusion of database-related SEP topics to also be\nspread across the curriculum.\nIn a similar vein one might have a whole course on the Role of Data from either a Security (SEC)\nperspective, or an Ethics (SEP) perspective.\nCommittee\nChair: Mikey Goldweber, Denison University, Granville, OH, USA\nMembers:\n● Sherif Aly, The American University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt\n● Sara More, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA\n● Mohamed Mokbel, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA\n● Rajendra K.

The 2022 Undergraduate Database Course in Computer Science: What to Teach?. Michael\nGoldweber, Min Wei, Sherif Aly, Rajendra K. Raj, and Mohamed Mokbel. ACM Inroads, 13, 3, 2022.\n125\n126\nFoundations of Programming Languages (FPL)\nPreamble\nThe foundations of programming languages are rooted in discrete mathematics, logic, and formal\nlanguages, and provide a basis for the understanding of complex modern programming languages.\nAlthough programming languages vary according to the language paradigm and the problem domain\nand evolve in response to both societal needs and technological advancement, they share an\nunderlying abstract model of computation and program development. This remains true even as\nprocessor hardware and their interface with programming tools become increasingly intertwined and\nprogressively more complex. An understanding of the common abstractions and programming\nparadigms enables faster learning of programming languages.\nThe Foundations of Programming Languages knowledge area is concerned with articulating the\nunderlying concepts and principles of programming languages, the formal specification of a\nprogramming language and the behavior of a program, explaining how programming languages are\nimplemented, comparing the strengths and weaknesses of various programming paradigms, and\ndescribing how programming languages interface with entities such as operating systems and\nhardware. The concepts covered here are applicable to several languages and an understanding of\nthese principles assists a learner to move readily from one language to another, as well as select a\nprogramming paradigm and language that best suits the problem at hand.\nProgramming languages are the medium through which programmers precisely describe concepts,\nformulate algorithms, and reason about solutions. Over the course of a career, a computer scientist will\nlearn and work with many different languages, separately or together. Software developers must\nunderstand different programming models, programming features and constructs, and underlying\nconcepts to make informed design choices among languages that support multiple complementary\napproaches. It would be useful to know how programming language features are defined, composed,\nand implemented to improve execution efficiency and long-term maintenance of developed software.\nAlso useful is a basic knowledge of language translation, program analysis, run-time behavior, memory\nmanagement and interplay of concurrent processes communicating with each other through message-\npassing, shared memory, and synchronization. Finally, some developers and researchers will need to\ndesign new languages, an exercise which requires greater familiarity with basic principles.\nChanges since CS2013\nChanges since 2013 include a change in name of the KA from Programming Languages to\nFoundations of Programming Languages to reflect the fact that the KA is about the fundamentals\nunderpinning programming languages, and related concepts, not about any specific programming\nlanguage. Changes also include a redistribution of content formerly identified as core Tier-1 and core\nTier-2 within the Programming Language Knowledge Area (KA). In CS2013, graduates were expected\nto complete all Tier-1 topics and 80% of Tier-2 topics, for a total of 24 required hours. These 24 hours\nare designated as CS Core topics in CS2023. The remaining Tier-2 topics are designated as KA Core\ntopics in CS2023. The change in core topics (Tier-1 plus 80% of Tier-2 hours) from 2013 reflects the\n127\nchange in importance or relevance of topics over the past decade. The inclusion of new topics was\ndriven by their current prominence in the programming language landscape, or the anticipated impact\nof emerging areas on the profession in general. Specifically, the changes are:\n● Object-Oriented Programming -4 CS Core hours\n● Functional Programming -2 CS Core hours\n● Event-Driven and Reactive Programming +1 CS Core hour\n● Parallel and Distributed Computing +3 CS Core hours\n● Type Systems -1 CS Core hour\n● Program Representation -1 CS Core hour\nIn addition, a number of knowledge units from CS2013 were renamed to reflect their content more\naccurately, as noted here.\n● Static Analysis was renamed Program Analysis and Analyzers.\n● Concurrency and Parallelism was renamed Parallel and Distributed Computing.\n● Program Representation was renamed Program Abstraction and Representation.\n● Runtime Systems was renamed Runtime Behavior and Systems.\n● Basic Type Systems and Type Systems were merged into a single topic and named Type\nSystems.\nSix new knowledge units were added to reflect their continuing and growing importance as we look\ntoward the 2030s:\n● Shell Scripting +2 CS Core hours\n● Systems Execution and Memory Model +3 CS Core hours\n● Formal Development Methodologies\n● Design Principles of Programming Languages\n● Fundamentals of Programming Languages\n● Society, Ethics, and the Profession\nNotes:\n● Several topics within this knowledge area either build on or overlap content covered in other\nknowledge areas such as the Software Development Fundamentals knowledge area in a\ncurriculum’s introductory courses. Curricula will differ on which topics are integrated in this\nfashion and which are postponed until later courses on software development and programming\nlanguages.\n● Different programming paradigms correspond to different problem domains. Most languages\nhave evolved to integrate more than one programming paradigm such as imperative with object-\noriented, functional programming with object-oriented, logic programming with object-oriented,\nand event and reactive modeling with object-oriented programming.\nHence, the emphasis is not on just one programming paradigm but on a balance of all major\nprogramming paradigms.\n● While the number of CS Core and KA Core hours is identified for each major programming\nparadigm (object-oriented, functional, logic), the distribution of hours across the paradigms may\ndiffer depending on the curriculum and programming languages students have been exposed to\n128\nleading up to coverage of this knowledge area. This document assumes that students have\nexposure to an object-oriented programming language leading into this knowledge area.\n● Imperative programming is not listed as a separate paradigm to be examined. Instead, it is\ntreated as a subset of the object-oriented paradigm.\n● With multicore computing, cloud computing, and computer networking becoming commonly\navailable in the market, it has become critical to understand the integration of “distribution,\nconcurrency, parallelism” along with other programming paradigms as a core area. This\nparadigm is integrated with almost all other major programming paradigms.\n● With ubiquitous computing and real-time temporal computing applications increasing in daily\nhuman life within domains such as health, transportation, smart homes, it has become important\nto cover the software development aspects of event-driven and reactive programming as well as\nparallel and distributed computing. A number of topics covered will require and overlap with\nconcepts in knowledge areas such as Architecture and Organization, Operating Systems, and\nSystems Fundamentals.\n● Some topics from the Parallel and Distributed Computing knowledge unit are likely to be\nintegrated within the curriculum with topics from the Parallel and Distributed Programming\nknowledge area.\n● There is an increasing interest in formal methods to prove program correctness and other\nproperties. To support this, additional coverage of topics related to formal methods has been\nincluded, but all these topics are identified as Non-core.\n● When introducing these topics, it is also important that an instructor provides context for this\nmaterial including why we have an interest in programming languages and what they do for us\nin terms of providing a human readable version of instructions for a computer to execute.\nCore Hours\nKnowledge Unit CS Core KA Core\nObject-Oriented Programming 4 + 1 (SDF) 1\nFunctional Programming 4 3\nLogic Programming 2 + 1 (MSF)\nShell Scripting 2\nEvent-Driven and Reactive Programming 2 2\nParallel and Distributed Computing 2 + 1 (PDC) 2\nAspect-Oriented Programming\nType Systems 3 3\nSystems Execution and Memory Model 2 + 1 (AR and\nOS)\n129\nLanguage Translation and Execution 2 3\nProgram Abstraction and Representation 3\nSyntax Analysis\nCompiler Semantic Analysis\nProgram Analysis and Analyzers\nCode Generation\nRuntime Behavior and Systems\nAdvanced Programming Constructs\nLanguage Pragmatics\nFormal Semantics\nFormal Development Methodologies\nDesign Principles of Programming Languages\nSociety, Ethics, and the Profession Included in SEP hours\nTotal 21 19\nThe CS and KA Core totals do not include the shared hours that have been counted in other knowledge\nareas.\nKnowledge Units"

Its\napplication domains include animation, Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) and Visual Effects (VFX);\nengineering; machine learning; medical imaging; scientific, information, and knowledge visualization;\nsimulators; special effects; user interfaces; and video games. Traditionally, graphics at the\nundergraduate level focused on rendering, linear algebra, physics, the graphics pipeline, interaction,\nand phenomenological approaches. Today’s graphics courses increasingly include data science,\nphysical computing, animation, and haptics. Thus, the knowledge area (KA) expanded beyond core\nimage-based computer graphics. At the advanced level, undergraduate institutions are more likely to\noffer one or several courses specializing in a specific graphics knowledge unit (KU) or topic: e.g.,\ngaming, animation, visualization, tangible or physical computing, and immersive courses such as\nAugmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR)/eXtended Reality (XR). There is considerable connection\nwith other computer science knowledge areas (KAs): Algorithmic Foundations, Architecture and\nOrganization, Artificial Intelligence; Human-Computer Interaction; Parallel and Distributed Computing;\nSpecialized Platform Development; Software Engineering; and Society, Ethics, and the Profession.\nFor students to become adept at the use and generation of computer graphics and interactive\ntechniques, many issues must be addressed, such as human perception and cognition, data and image\nfile formats, display specifications and protocols, hardware interfaces, and application program\ninterfaces (APIs). Unlike other knowledge areas, knowledge units within Graphics and Interactive\nTechniques may be included in a variety of elective courses. Alternatively, graphics topics may be\nintroduced in an applied project in courses primarily covering human computer interaction, embedded\nsystems, web development, introductory programming courses, etc. Undergraduate computer science\nstudents who study the knowledge units specified below through a balance of theory and applied\ninstruction will be able to understand, evaluate, and/or implement the related graphics and interactive\ntechniques as users and developers. Because technology changes rapidly, the Graphics and\nInteractive Techniques subcommittee attempted to avoid being overly prescriptive. Any examples of\nAPIs, programs, and languages should be considered as appropriate examples in 2023. In effect, this is\na snapshot in time.\nGraphics as a knowledge area has expanded and become pervasive since the CS2013 report.\nAR/VR/XR, artificial intelligence, computer vision, data science, machine learning, and interfaces driven\nby embedded sensors in everything from cars to coffee makers use graphics and interactive\ntechniques. The now ubiquitous smartphone has made much of the world’s population regular users\nand creators of graphics, digital images, and the interactive techniques to manipulate them. Animations,\ngames, visualizations, and immersive applications that ran on desktops in 2013, now can run on mobile\ndevices. The amount of stored digital data grew exponentially since 2013, and both data and\nvisualizations are now published by myriad sources including news media and scientific organizations.\nRevenue from mobile video games now exceeds that of music and movies combined [1]. CGI and VFX\nare employed in almost all films, animations, TV productions, advertising, and business graphics. The\n151\nnumber of people who create graphics has skyrocketed, as have the number of applications and\ngenerative tools used to produce graphics.\nIt is critical that students and faculty confront the ethical issues, questions, and conundrums that have\narisen and will continue to arise in and because of applications in computer graphics. Today’s\nheadlines unfortunately already provide examples of inequity and/or wrong-doing in autonomous\nnavigation, deepfakes, computational photography, generative images, and facial recognition.\nOverview of Knowledge Units\nThe following knowledge units are included in Graphics and Interactive Techniques. Descriptions are\nincluded below where they are not explicitly evident from the title. Graphics as a knowledge area is\nunique in that many of its knowledge units can and are taught as stand-alone courses where\nimplementation projects are critical to student mastery. Apart from Applied Rendering and Techniques\nwhich scaffolds the typical undergraduate interactive computer graphics course, the other knowledge\nunit are more specialized. To be consistent with the design of CS2023 those knowledge unit are limited\nto two weeks of instruction, corresponding roughly to 6 hours of instruction. This limitation allows a two-\nweek knowledge unit to be added to a course. Due to that time restriction, we list their Core Topic skill\nlevels in most of the knowledge units as “Explain.” However, if one of the thematic knowledge units is\nimplemented as a full-term course, our expectation is that the skill levels will rise to “Apply” or “Develop”\nwhich is reflected in many of the practical illustrative learning outcomes. This is not meant to be\nprescriptive but to encourage customization. How to implement a knowledge unit is left to the discretion\nof the instructor. If given a two-week constraint to teach one of the thematic knowledge units, many of\nus would choose to limit the topics and include an applied project. Our hope is that an inclusive list of\ntopics will help faculty design a course that best meets their and their department’s pedagogical goals.\n● GIT-Fundamentals: Fundamental Concepts. For nearly every computer scientist and\nsoftware developer, understanding of how humans interact with machines is essential.\n● GIT-Visualization: Visualization. Visualization seeks to determine and present underlying\ncorrelated structures and relationships in data sets from a wide variety of application areas. The\nprime objective is to communicate the information in a way which enhances understanding.\n● GIT-Rendering: Applied Rendering and Techniques. This unit includes basic rendering and\nfundamental graphics techniques that nearly every undergraduate course in graphics will cover\nand that are essential for further study in most graphics-related courses.\n● GIT-Modeling: Geometric Modeling. Graphics must be encoded in computer memory, often in\nthe form of a mathematical specification of shape and form.\n● GIT-Shading: Shading and Advanced Rendering. This unit contains more in-depth coverage\nof rendering topics.\n● GIT-Animation: Computer Animation. Computer Animation is concerned with the generation\nof moving imagery.\n● GIT-Simulation: Simulation. Simulation has strong ties to Computational Science. However, in\nthe graphics domain, simulation techniques are re-purposed to a different end. Rather than\ncreating predictive models, the goal instead is to achieve a mixture of physical plausibility and\n152\nartistic intention. To illustrate, the goals of “model surface tension in a liquid” and “produce a\ncrown splash” are related, but different. Depending on the simulation goals, covered topics may\nvary as shown.\n● Particle systems\n○ Integration methods (Forward Euler, Midpoint, Leapfrog)\n● Rigid Body Dynamics\n○ Particle systems\n○ Collision Detection\n○ Triangle/point\n○ Edge/edge\n● Cloth\n○ Particle systems\n○ Mass/spring networks\n○ Collision Detection\n● Particle-Based Water\n○ Integration methods\n○ Smoother Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) Kernels\n○ Signed Distance Function-Based Collisions\n● Grid-Based Smoke and Fire\n○ Semi-Lagrangian Advection\n○ Pressure Projection\n● Grid and Particle-Based Water\n○ Particle-Based Water\n● Grid-Based Smoke and Fire\n○ Semi-Lagrangian Advection\n○ Pressure Projection\n● Grid and Particle-Based Water\n○ Particle-Based Water\n○ Grid-Based Smoke, and Fire\n● GIT-Immersion: Immersion. Immersion includes Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR),\nand Mixed Reality (MR).\n● GIT-Interaction: Interaction. Interactive computer graphics is a requisite part of real-time\napplications ranging from the utilitarian-like word processors to virtual and/or augmented reality\napplications.\n● GIT-Image: Image Processing. Image Processing consists of the analysis and processing of\nimages for multiple purposes, but most frequently to improve image quality and to manipulate\nimagery. It lies at the cornerstone of computer vision.\n● GIT-Physical: Tangible/Physical Computing. Tangible/Physical Computing refers to\nmicrocontroller-based interactive systems that detect and respond to sensor input.\n● GIT-SEP: Society, Ethics, and the Profession.\n153\nChanges since CS2013\nIn order to align CS2013’s Graphics and Visualization areas with the ACM Special Interest Group on\nGraphic and Interactive Techniques (SIGGRAPH) and to reflect the natural expansion of the field to\ninclude haptic and physical computing in addition to images, we have renamed it Graphics and\nInteractive Techniques (GIT). To capture the expanded footprint of the knowledge area , the following\nfive knowledge units have been added to the original list consisting of Fundamental Concepts,\nVisualization, Basic Rendering (renamed Rendering), Geometric Modeling, Advanced Rendering\n(renamed Shading), and Computer Animation.\n● Immersion (MR, AR, VR)\n● Interaction\n● Image Processing\n● Tangible/Physical Computing\n● Simulation\nCore Hours\nKnowledge Unit CS Core KA Core\nFundamental Concepts 4 3\nVisualization 6\nApplied Rendering and 15\nTechniques\nGeometric Modeling 6\nShading and Advanced 6\nRendering\nComputer Animation 6\nSimulation 6\nImmersion (MR, AR, VR) 6\nInteraction 4\nImage Processing 6\nTangible/Physical Computing 6\nSociety, Ethics, and the Included in SEP hours\nProfession\n154\nTotal 4\nKnowledge Units"

Accessed March 2024.\n171\n172\nHuman-Computer Interaction (HCI)\nPreamble\nComputational systems not only enable users to solve problems, but also foster social connectedness\nand support a broad variety of human endeavors. Thus, these systems should work well with their\nusers and solve problems in ways that respect individual dignity, social justice, and human values and\ncreativity. Human-computer interaction (HCI) addresses those issues from an interdisciplinary\nperspective that includes computer science, psychology, business strategy, and design principles.\nEach user is different and, from the perspective of HCI, the design of every system that interacts with\npeople should anticipate and respect that diversity. This includes not only accessibility, but also cultural\nand societal norms, neural diversity, modality, and the responses the system elicits in its users. An\neffective computational system should evoke trust while it treats its users fairly, respects their privacy,\nprovides security, and abides by ethical principles.\nThese goals require design-centric engineering that begins with intention and with the understanding\nthat design is an iterative process, one that requires repeated evaluation of its usability and its impact\non its users. Moreover, technology evokes user responses, not only by its output, but also by the\nmodalities with which it senses and communicates. This knowledge area heightens the awareness of\nthese issues and should influence every computer scientist.\nChanges since CS2013\nDriven by this broadened perspective, the HCI knowledge area has revised the CS2013 document in\nseveral ways:\n● Knowledge units have been renamed and reformulated to reflect current practice and to anticipate\nfuture technological development.\n● There is increased emphasis on the nature of diversity and the centrality of design focused on the\nuser.\n● Modality (e.g., text, speech) is still emphasized given its key role throughout HCI, but with a\nreduced emphasis on specific modalities in favor of a more timely and empathetic approach.\n● The curriculum reflects the importance of understanding and evaluating the impacts and\nimplications of a computational system on its users, including issues in ethics, fairness, trust, and\nexplainability.\n● Given its extensive interconnections with other knowledge areas, we believe HCI is itself a cross-\ncutting knowledge area with connections to Artificial Intelligence, Graphics and Interactive\nTechniques, Software Development Fundamentals, Software Engineering, and Society, Ethics, and\nthe Profession.\n173\nCore Hours\nKnowledge Unit CS Core KA Core\nUnderstanding the User 2 5\nAccountability and Responsibility in Design 2 2\nAccessibility and Inclusive Design 2 2\nEvaluating the Design 1 2\nSystem Design 1 5\nSociety, Ethics, and the Profession Included in SEP hours\nTotal Hours 8 16\nKnowledge Units"

This Mathematical and Statistical Foundations (MSF) knowledge\narea – the successor to the ACM CS2013 [1] curriculum's \"Discrete Structures\" area – seeks to identify\nthe mathematical and statistical material that undergirds modern computer science. The change of\nname corresponds to a realization both that the broader name better describes the combination of\ntopics from the 2013 report and from those required for the recently growing areas of computer science,\nsuch as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, and quantum computing, many of which\nhave continuous mathematics as their foundations.\nThe committee sought the following inputs to prepare their recommendations:\n● A survey about mathematical preparation distributed to computer science faculty (nearly 600\nrespondents) across a variety of institutional types and in various countries;\n● Math-related curricular views amongst data collected from ACM’s survey of industry\nprofessionals (865 respondents);\n● Mathematics requirements stated by all the knowledge areas in the report;\n● Direct input from the computer science theory community; and\n● Review of past curricular reports including recent ones on data science (e.g., Park City report\n[2]) and quantum computing education.\nChanges since CS2013\nThe breadth of mathematics needed to address the mathematical needs of rapidly growing areas such\nas artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, data science, and quantum computing has grown\nbeyond discrete structures. These areas call for a renewed focus on probability, statistics, and linear\nalgebra, as supported by the faculty survey that asked respondents to rate various mathematical areas\nin their importance for both an industry career as well as for graduate school: the combined such\nratings for probability, statistics, and linear algebra, for example, were 98%, 98% and 89% respectively,\nreflecting a strong consensus in the computer science academic community.\nCore Hours\nAcknowledging some tensions\nSeveral challenges face computer science (CS) programs when weighing mathematics requirements:\n(1) many CS majors, perhaps aiming for a software career, are unenthusiastic about investing in\nmathematics; (2) institutions such as liberal-arts colleges often limit how many courses a major may\nrequire, while others may require common engineering courses that fill up the schedule; and (3) some\nprograms adopt a more pre-professional curricular outlook while others emphasize a more foundational\none. Thus, we are hesitant to recommend an all-encompassing set of mathematical topics that “every\n185\nCS degree must require.” Instead, we outline two sets of core requirements, a CS Core set suited to\nhours-limited majors and a more expansive set of CS Core plus KA Core to align with technically\nfocused programs. The principle here is that considering the additional foundational mathematics\nneeded for AI, data science, and quantum computing, programs ought to consider as much as possible\nfrom the more expansive CS+KA version unless there are sound institutional reasons for alternative\nrequirements.\nNote: the hours in a row (example: linear algebra) add up to 40 (= 5 + 35), reflecting a standard course;\nshorter combined courses may be created, for example, by including probability in discrete\nmathematics (29 hours of discrete mathematics, 11 hours of probability).\nKnowledge Unit CS Core KA Core\nDiscrete Mathematics 29 11\nProbability 11 29\nStatistics 10 30\nLinear Algebra 5 35\nCalculus 0 40\nTotal 55 145\nRationale for recommended hours",
      "CS Core: While some discrete mathematics courses include probability, we highlight its importance": "with a minimum number of hours (11) to reflect the strong consensus in the academic community\nbased on the survey. Taken together, the total CS Core across discrete mathematics and probability\n(40 hours) is typical of a one-term course. Fifteen hours are allotted to statistics and linear algebra for\nbasic definitions so that, for example, students should at least be familiar with terms like mean,\nstandard deviation, and vector. These could be covered in regular computer science courses. Many\nprograms typically include a broader statistics requirement.",
      "KA Core: The KA Core hours can be read as the remaining hours available to flesh out each topic into": "a standard 40-hour course. Note that the calculus hours roughly correspond to the typical Calculus-I\ncourse now standard across the world. Based on our survey, most programs already require Calculus-I.\nHowever, we have left out Calculus-II (an additional 40 hours) and left it to programs to decide whether\nCalculus-II should be added to program requirements. Programs could choose to require a more\nrigorous calculus-based probability or statistics sequence, or non-calculus-based versions. Similarly,\nlinear algebra can be taught as an applied course without a calculus prerequisite or as a more\nadvanced course.\n186\nKnowledge Units"

Perhaps the most important of the dispositions, students should be persuaded\nthat anyone can learn mathematics, certainly the subset foundational to CS, and that success is not\ndependent on innate ability.\n● Practice mindset. Students should be educated about the nature of “doing” mathematics and\nlearning through practice with problems as opposed to merely listening or observing demonstrations\nin the classroom.\n● Deferred gratification. Most students are likely to learn at least some mathematics from\nmathematics departments unfamiliar with computing applications; computing departments should\nacclimate the students to the notion of waiting to see computing applications. Many of the new\ngrowth areas such as AI or quantum computing can serve as motivation.\n● Persistence. Student perceptions are often driven by frustration with inability to solve hard\nproblems that they see some peers tackle seemingly effortlessly; computing departments should\nhelp promote the notion that eventual success through persistence is what matters.\n● Skepticism and inquiry. Students often look for “given formulas” as handed down by experts only\nto be memorized and used. Yet, a theoretical mindset and, more broadly, a scientific one, should\nfeature skepticism and a curiosity about how formulas are established.\nMathematics Requirements\nThe most important topics expected from students entering a computing program typically correspond\nto pre-calculus courses in high school.\nRequired:\n● Algebra and numeracy\no Numeracy: numbers, operations, types of numbers, fluency with arithmetic, exponent\nnotation, rough orders of magnitude, fractions, and decimals.\no Algebra: rules of exponents, solving linear or quadratic equations with one or two variables,\nfactoring, algebraic manipulation of expressions with multiple variables.\n● Precalculus\no Coordinate geometry: distances between points, areas of common shapes.\no Functions: function notation, drawing and interpreting graphs of functions.\n194\no Exponentials and logarithms: a general familiarity with the functions and their graphs.\no Trigonometry: familiarity with basic trigonometric functions and the unit circle.\nCourse Packaging Suggestions\nEvery department faces constraints in delivering content, which precludes merely requiring a long list of\ncourses covering every single desired topic. These constraints include content-area ownership, faculty\nsize, student preparation, and limits on the number of departmental courses a curriculum can require.\nWe list below some options for offering mathematical foundations, combinations of which might best fit\nany specific institution.\n● Traditional course offerings. With this approach, a computer science department can require\nstudents to take courses provided by mathematics departments in any of the five broad\nmathematical areas listed above.\n● A “Continuous Structures” analog of Discrete Structures. Many computer science departments\nnow offer courses that prepare students mathematically for AI and machine learning. Such courses\ncan combine just enough calculus, optimization, linear algebra, and probability; yet others may split\nlinear algebra into its own course. These courses have the advantage of motivating students with\ncomputing applications and including programming as pedagogy for mathematical concepts.\n● Integration into application courses. An application course, such as machine learning, can be\nspread across two courses, with the course sequence including the needed mathematical\npreparation taught just-in-time, or a single machine learning course can balance preparatory\nmaterial with new topics. This may have the advantage of mitigating turf issues and helping\nstudents see applications immediately after encountering mathematics.\n● Specific course adaptations. For nearly a century, physics and engineering needs have driven\nthe structure of calculus, linear algebra, and probability. Computer science departments can\ncollaborate with their colleagues in mathematics departments to restructure mathematics-offered\nsections in those areas that are driven by computer science applications. For example, calculus\ncould be reorganized to fit the needs of computing programs into two calculus courses, leaving a\nlater third calculus course for engineering and physics students.\nCommittee\nChair: Rahul Simha, The George Washington University, Washington DC, USA\nMembers:\n● Richard Blumenthal, Regis University, Denver, CO, USA\n● Marc Deisenroth, University College London, London, UK\n● MIkey Goldweber, Denison University, Granville, OH, USA\n● David Liben-Nowell, Carleton College, Northfield, MN, USA\n● Jodi Tims, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA\n195\nReferences\n1.

The public internet provides connectivity for networked\napplications that serve ever-increasing numbers of individuals and organizations around the world.\nComplementing the public sector, major proprietary networks leverage their global footprints to support\ncost-effective distributed computing, storage, and content delivery. Advances in satellite networks\nexpand connectivity to rural areas. Device-to-device communication underlies the emerging Internet of\nThings.\nThis knowledge area deals with key concepts in networking and communication, as well as their\nrepresentative instantiations in the internet and other computer networks. Besides the basic principles\nof switching and layering, the area at its core provides knowledge on naming, addressing, reliability,\nerror control, flow control, congestion control, domain hierarchy, routing, forwarding, modulation,\nencoding, framing, and access control. The area also covers knowledge units in network security and\nmobility, such as security threats, countermeasures, device-to-device communication, and multi-hop\nwireless networking. In addition to the fundamental principles, the area includes their specific realization\nof the Internet as well as hands-on skills in the implementation of networking and communication\nconcepts. Finally, the area comprises emerging topics such as network virtualization and quantum\nnetworking.\nAs the main learning outcome, learners develop a thorough understanding of the role and operation of\nnetworking and communication in networked computer systems. They learn how network structure and\ncommunication protocols affect the behavior of distributed applications. The area can be used to\neducate not only key principles but also their specific instantiations in the internet and equip the student\nwith hands-on implementation skills. While computer-system, networking, and communication\ntechnologies are advancing at a fast pace, the gained fundamental knowledge enables the student to\nreadily apply the concepts in new technological settings.\nChanges since CS2013\nCompared to the 2013 curricula, the knowledge area broadens its core focus to expand on reliability\nsupport, routing, forwarding, and single-hop communication. Due to the enhanced core, learners\nacquire a deeper understanding of the impact that networking and communication have on the behavior\nof distributed applications. Reflecting the increased importance of network security, the area adds a\nrespective knowledge unit as a new elective. To track the advancing frontiers in networking and\ncommunication knowledge, the social networking knowledge unit was removed and an emerging\nknowledge unit on topics, such as middleboxes, software-defined networks, and quantum networking,\nwas added. Other changes consist of redistributing all the topics from the old unit on resource allocation\namong other units to resolve overlap between knowledge units in the 2013 curricula.\n197\nCore Hours\nKnowledge Unit CS Core KA Core\nFundamentals 2.5 + 0.25 (SEP) + 0.25 (SF)\nNetworked Applications 3.5 + 0.25 (SEP) + 0.25\n(PDC)\nReliability Support 5.75 + 0.25 (SF)\nRouting And Forwarding 4\nSingle-Hop Communication 3\nMobility Support 4\nNetwork Security 2.25 + 0.5 (SEC) + 0.25\n(SEP)\nEmerging Topics 4\nTotal 7 24\nThe shared hours correspond to overlapping concepts that are covered from a networking perspective\nand are only counted here.\nKnowledge Units"

The ubiquity of parallelism and distribution are\ninevitable consequences of increasing numbers of gates in processors, processors in computers, and\ncomputers everywhere that may be used to improve performance compared to sequential programs,\nwhile also coping with the intrinsic interconnectedness of the world, and the possibility that some\ncomponents or connections fail or behave maliciously. Parallel and distributed programming removes\nthe restrictions of sequential programming that require computational steps to occur in a serial order in\na single place, revealing further distinctions, techniques, and analyses applying at each layer of\ncomputing systems.\nIn most conventional usage, “parallel” programming focuses on establishing and coordinating multiple\nactivities that may occur at the same time, “distributed” programming focuses on establishing and\ncoordinating activities that may occur in different places, and “concurrent” programming focuses on\ninteractions of ongoing activities with each other and the environment. However, all three terms may\napply in most contexts. Parallelism generally implies some form of distribution because multiple\nactivities occurring without sequential ordering constraints happen in multiple physical places (unless\nthey rely on context-switching or quantum effects). Conversely, actions in different places need not\nbear any specific sequential ordering with respect to each other in the absence of communication\nconstraints.\nParallel, distributed, and concurrent programming techniques form the core of High Performance\nComputing (HPC), distributed systems, and increasingly, nearly every computing application. The PDC\nknowledge area has evolved from a diverse set of advanced topics into a central body of knowledge\nand practice, permeating almost every other aspect of computing. Growth of the field has occurred\nirregularly across different subfields of computing, sometimes with different goals, terminology, and\npractices, masking the considerable overlap of basic ideas and skills that are the primary focus of this\nknowledge area. Nearly every problem with a sequential solution also admits parallel and/or distributed\nsolutions; additional problems and solutions arise only in the context of concurrency. Nearly every\napplication domain of parallel and distributed computing is a well-developed area of study and/or\nengineering too large to enumerate.\nChanges since CS2013\nThis knowledge area has been refactored to focus on commonalities across different forms of parallel\nand distributed computing, also enabling more flexibility in KA Core coverage, with more guidance on\ncoverage options.\nOverview\nThis knowledge area is divided into five knowledge units, each with CS Core and KA Core topics that\nextend but do not overlap CS Core coverage that appears in other knowledge areas. The five\n217\nknowledge units cover: The nature of parallel and distributed Programs and their execution;\nCommunication (via channels, memory, or shared data stores), Coordination among parallel\nactivities to achieve common outcomes; Evaluation with respect to specifications, and Algorithms\nacross multiple application domains.\nCS Core topics span approaches to parallel and distributed computing but restrict coverage to those\nthat apply to nearly all of them. Learning outcomes include developing small programs (in a choice of\nseveral styles) with multiple activities and analyzing basic properties. The topics and hours do not\ninclude coverage of specific languages, tools, frameworks, systems, and platforms needed as a basis\nfor implementing and evaluating concepts and skills. The topics also avoid reliance on specifics that\nmay vary widely (for example GPU programming vs cloud container deployment scripts), Prerequisites\nfor CS Core coverage include the following.\n● SDF-Fundamentals: programs, executions, specifications, implementations, variables, arrays,\nsequential control flow, procedural abstraction and invocation, Input/Output.\n● SF-Overview: Layered systems, state machines, reliability.\n● AR-Assembly, AR-Memory: von Neumann architecture, memory hierarchy.\n● MSF-Discrete: Discrete structures including directed graphs.\nAdditionally, Foundations of Programming Languages (FPL) may be treated as a prerequisite,\ndepending on other curricular choices. CS Core requires familiarity with languages and platforms that\nenable construction of parallel and distributed programs. Also, PDC includes definitions of safety,\nliveness, and related concepts that are covered with respect to language properties and semantics in\nFPL. Similarly, PDC CS Core includes concepts that are further developed in the context of network\nprotocols in Networking and Communication (NC), Operating Systems (OS), and Security (SEC), that\ncould be covered in any order.\nKA Core topics in each unit are of the form “one or more of the following” for a la carte topics extending\nassociated core topics. Any selection of KA-core topics meeting the KA Core hour requirement\nconstitutes fulfillment of the KA Core. This structure permits variation in coverage depending on the\nfocus of any given course (see below for examples). Depth of coverage of any KA Core subtopic is\nexpected to vary according to course goals. For example, shared-memory coordination is a central\ntopic in multicore programming, but much less so in most heterogeneous systems, and conversely for\nbulk data transfer. Similarly, fault tolerance is central to the design of distributed information systems,\nbut much less so in most data-parallel applications.\nCore Hours\nKnowledge Unit CS Core hours KA Core hours\nPrograms 2 2\nCommunication 2 6\nCoordination 2 6\n218\nEvaluation 1 3\nAlgorithms 2 9\nSociety, Ethics, and the Profession Included in SEP hours\nTotal 9 26\nKnowledge Units"

More conventional choices include courses that focus on one\nor a few categories (such as multicore or cluster), and algorithmic domains (such as linear algebra, or\nresource management).

To\nuse computers to solve problems most effectively, students must be competent at reading and writing\nprograms. Beyond programming skills, however, they must be able to select and use appropriate data\nstructures and algorithms and use modern development and testing tools.\nThe SDF knowledge area brings together fundamental concepts and skills related to software\ndevelopment, focusing on concepts and skills that should be taught early in a computer science\nprogram, typically in the first year. This includes fundamental programming concepts and their effective\nuse in writing programs, use of fundamental data structures which may be provided by the\nprogramming language, basics of programming practices for writing good quality programs, reading,\nand understanding programs, and some understanding of the impact of algorithms on the performance\nof the programs. The 43 hours of material in this knowledge area may be augmented with core material\nfrom other knowledge areas as students progress to mid- and upper-level courses.\nThis knowledge area assumes a contemporary programming language with built-in support for common\ndata types including associative data types like dictionaries/maps as the vehicle for introducing\nstudents to programming (e.g., Python, Java). However, this is not to discourage the use of older or\nlower-level languages for SDF — the knowledge units below can be suitably adapted for the actual\nlanguage used.\nThe emergence of generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), which can generate programs\nfor many programming tasks, will undoubtedly affect the programming profession and consequently the\nteaching of many CS topics. However, to be able to effectively use generative AI in programming tasks,\na programmer must have a good understanding of programs, and hence must still learn the foundations\nof programming and develop basic programming skills - which is the aim of SDF. Consequently, we feel\nthat the desired outcomes for SDF should remain the same, though different instructors may now give\nmore emphasis to program understanding, documenting, specifications, analysis, and testing. (This is\nlike teaching students multiplication, addition, etc. even though calculators can be used to do them).\nChanges since CS 2013\nThe main change from 2013 is a stronger emphasis on developing fundamental programming skills and\neffective use of in-built data structures (which many contemporary languages provide) for problem\nsolving.\nOverview\nThis Knowledge Area has five knowledge units which follow.\n1. SDF-Fundamentals: Fundamental Programming Concepts and Practices – This knowledge unit\naims to develop an understanding of basic concepts, and the ability to fluently use basic language\n229\nconstructs as well as modularity constructs. It also aims to familiarize students with the concept of\ncommon libraries and frameworks, including those to facilitate API-based access to resources.\n2. SDF-Data-Structures: Fundamental Data Structures – This knowledge unit aims to develop core\nconcepts relating to Data Structures and associated operations. Students should understand the\nimportant data structures available in the programming language or as libraries, and how to use\nthem effectively, including choosing appropriate data structures while designing solutions for a\ngiven problem.\n3. SDF-Algorithms: Algorithms – This knowledge unit aims to develop the foundations of algorithms\nand their analysis. The KU should also empower students in selecting suitable algorithms for\nbuilding modest-complexity applications.\n4. SDF-Practices: Software Development Practices – This knowledge unit develops the core\nconcepts relating to modern software development practices. It aims to develop student\nunderstanding and basic competencies in program testing, enhancing the readability of programs,\nand using modern methods and tools including some general-purpose IDE.\n5. SDF-SEP: Society, Ethics, and the Profession – This knowledge unit aims to develop an initial\nunderstanding of some of the ethical issues related to programming, professional values\nprogrammers need to have, and the responsibility to society that programmers have. This\nknowledge unit is a part of the SEP Knowledge Area.\nCore Hours\nKnowledge Unit CS Core KA Core\nFundamental Programming Concepts 20\nand Practices\nFundamental Data Structures 6 + 6 (AL)\nAlgorithms 3 + 3 (AL)\nSoftware Development Practices 5\nSociety, Ethics and the Profession Included in SEP hours\nTotal 43\nNote: The CS Core hours include 9 hours shared with AL, but counted here.\nKnowledge Units"

(See also: MSF-\nDiscrete)\nCourse Packaging Suggestions\nThe SDF KA will generally be covered in introductory courses, often called CS1 and CS2. How much of\nthe SDF KA can be covered in CS1 and how much is to be left for CS2 is likely to depend on the choice\nof programming language for CS1. For languages like Python or Java, CS1 can cover all the\nProgramming Concepts and Development Methods KAs, and some of the Data Structures KA. It is\ndesirable that they be further strengthened in CS2. The topics under algorithms KA and some topics\nunder data structures KA can be covered in CS2. In case CS1 uses a language with fewer in-built data\nstructures, then much of the Data Structures KA and some aspects of the programming KA may also\nneed to be covered in CS2. With the former approach, the introductory course in programming can\ninclude the following:\n1. SDF-Fundamentals (20 hours)\n2. SDF-Data-Structures (12 hours)\n3. SDF-Algorithms (6 hours)\n4. SDF-Practices (5 hours)\n5. SDF-SEP\nPrerequisites: High school mathematics, specifically Sets, Relations, Functions, and Logic. (See also:\nMSF-Discrete)\nCourse objectives: At the end of the course, students should be able to:\n● Design, code, test, and debug a modest sized program that effectively uses functional\nabstraction.\n● Select and use the appropriate language-provided data structure for a given problem (like\narrays, tuples/records/structs, lists, stacks, queues, and associative data types like sets,\ndictionaries/maps.)\n● Design, code, test, and debug a modest-sized object-oriented program using classes and\nobjects.\n● Design, code, test, and debug a modest-sized program that uses language provided libraries\nand frameworks (including accessing data from the web through APIs).\n● Read and explain given code including tracing the flow of control during execution.\n● Write specifications of a program or a module in natural language explaining what it does.\n● Build, execute and debug programs using a modern IDE and associated tools such as visual\ndebuggers.\n● Explain the key concepts relating to programming like parameter passing, recursion, runtime\nexceptions and exception handling.\n234\nCommittee\nChair: Pankaj Jalote, Chair, IIIT-Delhi, Delhi, India\nMembers:\n● Brett A.

Skilled software engineers must demonstrate expertise in communication and collaboration.\nProgramming may be an individual activity, but software engineering is a collaborative one, deeply tied\nto issues of professionalism, teamwork, and communication.\nSecond, a software engineering project is usually “multi-version.” It has an expected lifespan; it needs\nto function properly for months, years, or decades. Features may be added or removed to meet product\nrequirements. The engineering team itself will likely change. The technological context will shift, as our\ncomputing platforms evolve, programming languages change, dependencies upgrade, etc. This\nexposure to matters of time and change is novel when compared to a programming project: it isn’t\nenough to build a thing that works, instead it must work and stay working. Many of the most challenging\ntopics in tech share “time will lead to change” as a root cause: backward compatibility, version skew,\ndependency management, schema changes, protocol evolution.\nSoftware engineering presents a particularly difficult challenge for learning in an academic setting.\nGiven that the major differences between programming and software engineering are time and\nteamwork, it is hard to generate lessons that require successful teamwork and that faithfully present the\nchallenges of time. Additionally, some topics in software engineering will be more authentic and more\nrelevant if our learners experience collaborative and long-term software engineering projects in vivo\nrather than in the classroom. Regardless of whether that happens as an internship, involvement in an\nopen-source project, or full-time engineering role, a month of full-time hands-on experience has more\navailable hours than the average software engineering course.\nThus, a software engineering curriculum must focus on concepts needed by most new-graduate hires,\nand that either are novel for those who are trained primarily as programmers, or that are abstract\nconcepts that may not get explicitly stated/shared on the job. Such topics include, but are not limited to:\n● Testing\n● Teamwork, collaboration\n● Communication\n● Design\n● Maintenance and evolution\n● Software engineering tools\nSome such material is reasonably suited to a standard lecture or lecture + lab course. Discussing\ntheoretical underpinnings of version control systems, or branching strategies in such systems, can be\nan effective way to familiarize students with those ideas. Similarly, a theoretical discussion can highlight\n237\nthe difference between static and dynamic analysis tools or may motivate discussion of diamond\ndependency problems in dependency networks.\nOn the other hand, many of the fundamental topics of software engineering are best experienced in a\nhands-on fashion. Historically, project-oriented courses have been a common vehicle for such learning.\nWe believe that such experience is valuable but also bears some interesting risks: students may form\nerroneous notions about the difficulty/complexity of collaboration if their only exposure is a single\nproject with teams formed of other novice software engineers. It falls to instructors to decide on the right\nbalance between theoretical material and hands-on projects – neither is a perfect vehicle for this\nchallenging material. We strongly encourage instructors of project courses to aim for iteration and fast\nfeedback – a few simple tasks repeated, as in an Agile-structured project, is better than singular high-\nfriction introductions to many types of tasks. Projects with real-world industry partners and clients are\nalso especially encouraged. If long-running project courses are not an option, anything that can expose\nlearners to the collaborative and long-term aspects of software engineering is valuable – adding\nfeatures to an existing codebase, collaborating on distinct parts of a larger whole, pairing up to write an\nencoder and decoder, etc.\nAll evidence suggests that the role of software in our society will continue to grow for the foreseeable\nfuture. Additionally, the era of “two programmers in a garage” seems to have drawn to a close. Most\nimportant software these days is a team effort, building on existing code and leveraging existing\nfunctionality. The study of software engineering skills is a deeply important counterpoint to the everyday\nexperience of computing students – we must impress on them the reality that few software projects are\nmanaged by writing from scratch as a solo endeavor. Communication, teamwork, planning, testing, and\ntooling are far more important as our students move on from the classroom and make their mark on the\nwider world.\nAlthough most CS graduates will go on to an industry position that requires this material, the CS Core\ntopics presented here are of value regardless of whether graduates go on to industry or academia.\nChanges since CS 2013\nThis document shifts the focus of the Software Engineering knowledge area in a few ways compared to\nthe goals of CS2013. The common reason behind most of these changes is to focus on material that\nlearners would not pick up elsewhere in the curriculum, and that will be relevant immediately upon\ngraduation, rather than at some future point in their careers.\n● More explicit focus on the software workflow (version control, testing, code review, tooling).\n● Less focus on team leadership and project management.\n● More focus on team participation, communication, and collaboration.\nOverview\n1. SE-Teamwork: Because of the nature of learning programming, most students in introductory SE\nhave little or no exposure to the collaborative nature of SE. Practice (for instance in project work)\nmay help, but lecture and discussion time spent on the value of clear, effective, and efficient\ncommunication and collaboration is essential for Software Engineering.\n238\n2. SE-Tools: Industry reliance on SE tools has exploded in the past generation, with version control\nbecoming ubiquitous, testing frameworks growing in popularity, increased reliance on static and\ndynamic analysis in practice, and the near-ubiquitous use of continuous integration systems.\nIncreasingly powerful IDEs provide code searching and indexing capabilities, as well as small scale\nrefactoring tools and integration with other SE tools. An understanding of the nature of these tools is\nbroadly valuable - especially version control systems.\n3. SE-Requirements: Knowing how to build something is of little help if we do not know what to build.\nProduct Requirements (aka Requirements Engineering, Product Design, Product Requirements\nsolicitation, Product Requirements Documents, etc.) introduces students to the processes\nsurrounding the specification of the broad requirements governing development of a new product or\nfeature.\n4. SE-Design: While Product Requirements focus on the user-facing functionality of a software\nsystem, Software Design focuses on the engineer-facing design of internal software components.\nThis encompasses large design concerns such as software architecture, as well as small-scale\ndesign choices like API design.\n5. SE-Construction: Software Construction focuses on practices that influence the direct production\nof software: use of tests, test driven development, coding style. More advanced topics extend into\nsecure coding, dependency injection, work prioritization, etc.\n6. SE-Validation: Software Verification and Validation focuses on how to improve the value of testing\n– understand the role of testing, failure modes, and differences between good tests and poor ones.\n7. SE-Refactoring: Refactoring and Code Evolution focuses on refactoring and maintenance\nstrategies, incorporating code health, use of tools, and backwards compatibility considerations.\n8. SE-Reliability: Software Reliability aims to improve understanding of and attention to error cases,\nfailure modes, redundancy, and reasoning about fault tolerance.\n9. SE-Formal: Formal Methods provides mathematically rigorous mechanisms to apply to software,\nfrom specification to verification.

With rampant attacks on and\nbreaches of this infrastructure, computer science graduates have an important role in designing,\nimplementing, and operating software systems that are robust, safe, and secure.\nThe Security (SEC) knowledge area focuses on developing a security mindset into the overall ethos of\ncomputer science graduates so that security is embedded in all their work products. Computer science\nstudents need to learn about system vulnerabilities and understand threats against computer systems.\nThe Security title choice was intentional to serve as a one-word umbrella term for this knowledge area,\nwhich also includes concepts to support privacy, cryptography, secure systems, secure data, and\nsecure code.\nThe SEC knowledge area relies on shared concepts pervasive in all the other areas of CS2023. It\nidentifies seven crosscutting concepts of cybersecurity: confidentiality, integrity, availability, risk\nassessment, systems thinking, adversarial thinking, and human-centered thinking. The seventh\nconcept, human-centered thinking, is additional to the six crosscutting concepts originally defined in the\nCybersecurity Curricula 2017 (CSEC2017) [1]. This addition reinforces to students that humans are\nalso a link in the overall chain of security, a theme that is also covered in knowledge areas such as\nHCI. Principles of protecting systems (also in the DM, OS, SDF, SE and SF knowledge areas) include\nsecurity-by-design, privacy-by-design, defense-in-depth, and zero-trust.\nAnother concept is the notion of assurance, which is an attestation that security mechanisms need to\ncomply with the security policies that have been defined for data, processes, and systems. Assurance\nis tied in with the concepts of verification and validation in the SE knowledge area. Considerations of\ndata privacy and security are shared with the DM (technical aspects) and SEP knowledge areas.\nThe SEC knowledge area thus sits atop several of the other CS2023 knowledge areas, while including\nadditional concepts that are not present in those knowledge areas. The specific dependence on other\nknowledge areas is stated below, starting with the Core Hours table. CS2023 treats security as a\ncrucial component of the skillset of any CS graduate, and the hours needed for security preparation\ncome from all the other 16 CS2023 knowledge areas.\nChanges since CS2013\nThe Security knowledge area is an updated name for CS2013’s Information Assurance and Security\n(IAS) knowledge area. Since 2013, Information Assurance and Security has been rebranded as\nCybersecurity, which has become a new computing discipline, with its own curricular guidelines (CSEC\n2017) developed by a Joint Task Force of the ACM, IEEE Computer Society, AIS and IFIP in 2017.\nMoreover, since 2013, other curricular recommendations for cybersecurity beyond CS2013 and CSEC\n2017 have been made. In the US, the National Security Agency recognizes institutions as Centers of\n255\nAcademic Excellence (CAE) in Cyber Defense and/or Cyber Operations if their cybersecurity programs\nmeet the respective CAE curriculum requirements. Additionally, the National Initiative for Cybersecurity\nEducation (NICE) of the US National Institute for Standards and Technologies (NIST) has developed\nand revised the Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Workforce Framework), which identifies\ncompetencies (knowledge and skills) needed to perform tasks relevant to cybersecurity work roles. The\nEuropean Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF) includes a standard ontology to describe\ncybersecurity tasks and roles, as well as addressing the cybersecurity personnel shortage in EU\nmember countries. Similarities and differences of these cybersecurity guidelines, viewed from the CS\nperspective, also informed the SEC knowledge area.\nBuilding on CS2013’s recognition of the pervasiveness of security in computer science, the CS2023\nSEC knowledge area focuses on ensuring that students develop a security mindset so that they are\nprepared for the continual changes occurring in computing. One useful addition is the knowledge unit\nfor security analysis, design, and engineering to support the concepts of security-by-design and\nprivacy-by-design.\nThe importance of computer science in ensuring the protection of future computing systems and\nsocietal critical infrastructure will continue to grow. Consequently, it is imperative that faculty teaching\ncomputer science incorporate the latest advances in security and privacy approaches to keep their\ncurriculum current.\nDifferences between CS2023 Security knowledge area and Cybersecurity\nCS2023’s SEC knowledge area focuses on those aspects of security, privacy, and related concepts\nimportant for computer science students. In comparison, CSEC 2017 characterizes similarities and\ndifferences in the cybersecurity book of knowledge using the disciplinary lenses of computer science,\ncomputer engineering, software engineering, information systems, information technology, and other\ndisciplines. In short, the major goal of the SEC knowledge area is to ensure that computer science\ngraduates can design and develop more secure code, ensure data security and privacy, and apply a\nsecurity mindset to their daily activities.\nProtecting what happens within the perimeter of a networked computer system is a core competency of\ncomputer science graduates. Although the computer science and cybersecurity knowledge units\noverlap, the demands upon cybersecurity graduates typically are to protect the perimeter. CSEC 2017\ndefines cybersecurity as a highly interdisciplinary field of study that covers eight areas (data, software,\ncomponent, connection, system, human, organizational, and societal security) and prepares its\nstudents for both technical and managerial roles in cybersecurity.\nThe first five CSEC 2017 areas are technical and have overlaps with the CS2023 SEC knowledge area,\nbut the intent of coverage is substantively different as computer science students bring to bear the core\ncompetencies described in all the 17 CS2023 knowledge areas. For instance, consider the SEC\nknowledge area’s Secure Coding knowledge unit. The computer science student will need to view this\nknowledge unit from a computer science lens, as an extension of the material covered in the SDF, SE,\nand PDC knowledge areas, while the Cybersecurity student will need to view software security in the\noverall context of diverse cybersecurity goals. These viewpoints are not totally distinct and have\n256\noverlaps, but thFFe lenses used to examine and present the content are different. There are similar\ncommonalities aii nd differences among CS2023 SEC knowledge units and corresponding CSEC 2017\ngg\nknowledge units.\nuu\nrr\nCore Hours\nee\n..\nDD\nKnowledgaae Unit CS Core KA Core\ntt\nFoundatioaan al Security 1 + 7 (DM, FPL, PDC, SDF, 7\nSS\nSE, OS)\nee\ncc\nSociety, Ethics, and the Profession 1 + 4 (SEP) 2\nuu\nrr\nSecure Coding 2 + 6 (FPL, SDF, SE) 5\nii\ntt\nCryptograyyp hy 1 + 8 (MSF) 4\n––\nSecurity ACCnalysis, Design, and Engineering 1 + 4 (MSF, SE) 8\nyy\nDigital Fobbrensics 0 6\nee\nSecurity Grrovernance 0 3\nss\nee\nTotal hours 6 35\ncc\nuu\nrr\nii\nThe SEC knowledge area requires approximately 28 hours of CS Core hours from the other knowledge\ntt\nareas, either to yyp rovide the basis or to complement its content.

Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education. 2017. Cybersecurity Curricula 2017. ACM, IEEE-CS,\nAIS SIGSEC, and IFIP WG 11.8. https://doi.org/10.1145/3184594\n267\n268\nSociety, Ethics, and the Profession (SEP)\nPreamble\nThe ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct states: “Computing professionals' actions change\nthe world. To act responsibly, they should reflect upon the wider impacts of their work, consistently\nsupporting the public good.” The IEEE Code of Ethics starts by recognizing “the importance of our\ntechnologies in affecting the quality of life throughout the world.” The AAAI Code of Professional Ethics\nand Conduct begins with “Computing professionals, and in particular, AI professionals’ actions change\nthe world. To act responsibly, they should reflect upon the wider impacts of their work, consistently\nsupporting the public good.”\nWhile technical issues dominate the computing curriculum, they do not constitute a complete\neducational program in the broader context. It is more evident today than ever that students must also\nbe exposed to the larger societal context of computing to develop an understanding of the critical and\nrelevant social, ethical, legal, and professional issues and responsibilities at hand. This need to\nincorporate the study of these non-technical issues into the ACM curriculum was formally recognized in\n1991, as articulated in the following excerpt from CS1991 [1].\nUndergraduates also need to understand the basic cultural, social, legal, and ethical issues\ninherent in the discipline of computing. They should understand where the discipline has been,\nwhere it is, and where it is heading. They should also understand their individual roles in this\nprocess, as well as appreciate the philosophical questions, technical problems, and aesthetic\nvalues that play an important part in the development of the discipline.\nStudents also need to develop the ability to ask serious questions about the social impact of\ncomputing and to evaluate proposed answers to those questions. Future practitioners must be\nable to anticipate the impact of introducing a given product into a given environment. Will that\nproduct enhance or degrade the quality of life? What will the impact be upon individuals,\ngroups, and institutions?\nFinally, students need to be aware of the basic legal rights of software and hardware vendors\nand users, and they also need to appreciate the ethical values that are the basis for those\nrights. Future practitioners must understand the responsibility that they will bear, and the\npossible consequences of failure. They must understand their own limitations as well as the\nlimitations of their tools. All practitioners must make a long-term commitment to remaining\ncurrent in their chosen specialties and in the discipline of computing as a whole.\nNonetheless, in recent years myriad high-profile issues affecting society at large have occurred leading\nto the conclusion that computer science professionals are not as prepared as they should be.\nAs technological advances (more specifically, how these advances are used by humans) continue to\nsignificantly impact the way we live and work, the critical importance of social and ethical issues and\nprofessional practice continues to increase in magnitude and consequence. The ways we use\n269\ncomputing products and platforms, while hopefully providing opportunities, also introduce ever more\nchallenging problems. A recent example is the emergence of generative AI, including large language\nmodels that generate code. A 2020 Communications of the ACM article [4] stated: “... because\ncomputing as a discipline is becoming progressively more entangled within the human and social\nlifeworld, computing as an academic discipline must move away from engineering-inspired curricular\nmodels and integrate the analytic lenses supplied by social science theories and methodologies.”\nIn parallel to, and as part of, the heightened awareness of the social consequences computing has on\nthe world, computing communities have become much more aware – and active – in areas of diversity,\nequity, inclusion, and accessibility. These feature in statements and initiatives at ACM [8], IEEE [9], and\nAAAI [10] and in their codes of conduct [1-3]. All students deserve an inclusive, diverse, equitable and\naccessible learning environment. Computing students also have a unique duty to ensure that when put\nto practice, their skills, knowledge, and competencies are applied in ways that work for, and not\nagainst, the principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. These principles are inherently a\npart of computing, and a new knowledge unit “Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility” (SEP-DEIA)\nhas been added to this knowledge area.\nComputer science educators may opt to deliver the material in this knowledge area within the contexts\nof traditional technical and theoretical courses, in dedicated courses, and as part of capstone, project,\nand professional practice courses. The material in this knowledge area is best covered through a\ncombination of all the above. It is too commonly held that many topics in this knowledge area may not\nreadily lend themselves to being covered in other more traditional computer science courses. However,\nmany of these topics naturally arise in traditional courses, or can be included with minimal effort. The\nbenefits of exposing students to SEP topics within the context of those traditional courses are\ninvaluable. Nonetheless institutional challenges will present barriers; for instance, some of these\ntraditional courses may not be offered at a given institution and, in such cases, it is difficult to cover\nthese topics appropriately without a dedicated SEP course. If social, ethical, and professional\nconsiderations are covered only in a dedicated course and not in the context of others, it could reinforce\nthe false notion that technical processes are void of these important aspects, or that they are more\nisolated than they are. Because of the broad relevance of these knowledge units, it is important that as\nmany traditional courses as possible include aspects such as case studies, that analyze ethical, legal,\nsocial, and professional considerations in the context of the technical subject matter of those courses.\nCourses in areas such as software engineering, databases, computer graphics, computer networks,\ninformation assurance & security, and introduction to computing, all provide obvious context for\nanalysis of such issues. However, an ethics-related module could be developed for almost any\nprogram. It would be explicitly against the spirit of these recommendations to have only a dedicated\ncourse within a specific computer science curriculum without great practical reason. Further, these\ntopics should be covered in courses starting from year 1. Presenting them as advanced topics in later\ncourses only creates an artificial perception that SEP topics are only important at a certain level or\ncomplexity. While it is true that the importance and consequence of SEP topics increases with level and\ncomplexity, introductory topics are not devoid of SEP topics. Further, many SEP topics are best\npresented early to lay a foundation for more intricate topics later in the curriculum.\n270\nRunning through all the topics in this knowledge area is the need to speak to the computing\npractitioner’s responsibility to proactively address issues through both ethical and technical actions.\nToday it is important not only for the topics in this knowledge area, but for students’ knowledge in\ngeneral, that the ethical issues discussed in any course should be directly related to – and arise\nnaturally from – the subject matter of that course. Examples include a discussion in a database course\nof the SEP aspects of data aggregation or data mining; or a discussion in a software engineering\ncourse of the potential conflicts between obligations to the customer and users as well as all others\naffected by their work. Computing faculty who are unfamiliar with the content and/or pedagogy of\napplied ethics are urged to take advantage of the considerable resources from ACM, IEEE-CS, AAAI,\nSIGCAS (ACM Special Interest Group on Computers and Society), and other organizations.\nAdditionally, it is the educator’s responsibility to impress upon students that this area is just as\nimportant – in ways more important – than technical areas. The societal, ethical, and professional\nknowledge gained in studying topics in this knowledge area will be used throughout one’s career and\nare transferable between projects, jobs, and often even industries, particularly as one’s career\nprogresses into project leadership and management.\nThe ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct [5], the IEEE Code of Ethics [6], and the AAAI\nCode of Professional Ethics and Conduct [7] provide guidance that serve as the basis for the conduct of\nall computing professionals in their work. The ACM Code emphasizes that ethical reasoning is not an\nalgorithm to be followed, and computer professionals are expected to consider how their work impacts\nthe public good as the primary consideration. It falls to computing educators to highlight the domain-\nspecific role of these topics for our students, but computer science programs should certainly be willing\nto lean on complementary courses from the humanities and social sciences.\nMost computing educators are not also moral philosophers. Yet CS2023, along with past CS curricular\nrecommendations, indicate the need for ethical analysis. CS2023 and prior curricular recommendations\nare quite clear on the required mathematical foundations that students are expected to gain which are\noften delivered by mathematics departments. Yet, the same is not true of moral philosophy. No one\nwould expect a student to be able to provide a proof by induction until after having successfully\ncompleted a course in discrete mathematics. Yet, the parallel with respect to ethical analyses is\nsomehow absent. We seemingly do (often) expect our students to perform ethical analysis without\nhaving the appropriate prerequisite knowledge from philosophy. Further, the application of ethical\nanalysis also underlies every other knowledge unit in this knowledge area. We acknowledge that the\nknowledge unit Methods for Ethical Analysis (SEP-Ethical-Analysis) is the only one in this knowledge\narea that does not readily lend itself to being taught in the context of other CS2023 knowledge areas.\nSuggestions in terms of addressing this appear in the Course Packaging Suggestions.\nThe lack of prerequisite training in social, ethical, and professional topics has facilitated graduates\noperating with a certain ethical egoism (e.g., ‘Here is what I believe/think/feel is right’). Regardless of\nhow well intentioned, one might conclude that this is what brought us to a point in history where there\nare frequent occurrences of unintended consequences of technology, serious data breaches, and\nsoftware failures causing economic, emotional. and physical harm. Certainly, computing graduates who\nhave learned how to apply the various ethical frameworks or lenses proposed through the ages would\nonly serve to improve this situation. In retrospect, to ignore the lessons from moral philosophy, which\n271\nhave been debated and refined for millennia – on what it means to act justly, or work for the common\ngood – appears as hubris.\nA computer science student must not graduate without understanding how society and ethics influence\nthe computing profession. Nor should it be possible to complete a computer science degree without\nlearning how computing professionals influence society, the ethical considerations involved in shaping\nthat impact, and the student-turned-graduate’s role in these relationships, as both computing\nprofessionals and members of society.\nChanges Since CS2013\n● The overall number of hours dedicated to this knowledge unit has doubled since CS2013 from 16 to\n32 – CS2013 had 11 ‘Tier 1’ hours and 5 ‘Tier 2’ hours while CS2023 has 18 CS Core hours and 14\nKA Core hours). However, many of these hours are best covered within the context of other\nknowledge areas as discussed in the introduction to CS2023. Additionally:\n○ Several knowledge units that were ‘elective only’ in CS2013 now have CS Core and KA\nCore hours.\n○ The number of hours in most knowledge units has increased.\n● SEP has been re-titled from “Social Issues and Professional Practice” to “Society, Ethics, and the\nProfession.” Our rationale follows.\n○ Professional practice is an important part of being a professional. However, a solid\nunderstanding of the profession in which one is to become a professional is needed –\nindeed it is a prerequisite. Through this lens, professional conduct is part of a profession,\nalong with its history, values, norms, etc. Additionally, “the profession” appears in the ACM\ntagline “Advancing Computing as a Science & Profession”, and the ACM code [5]: “The\nACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct …expresses the conscience of the\nprofession.” In a similar way the AAAI Code [7] states that it “...expresses the conscience of\nthe AI profession”, and the IEEE code [6] states: “in accepting a personal obligation to our\nprofession, its members and the communities we serve, do hereby commit ourselves to the\nhighest ethical and professional conduct.” While studying computing, students should not\nonly learn how to become professionals, but also learn about the profession in which they\nwill become professionals.\n● Inclusion of the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA) knowledge unit.\n● Changed titles of two knowledge units\n○ Professional Communication -> Communication\n○ Analytical Tools -> Methods for Ethical Analysis\nCore Hours\nKnowledge Unit CS Core KA Core\nSocial Context 3 2\nMethods for Ethical Analysis 2 1\n272\nProfessional Ethics 2 2\nIntellectual Property 1 1\nPrivacy and Civil Liberties 2 1\nCommunication 2 1\nSustainability 1 1\nHistory 1 1\nEconomies of Computing 0 1\nSecurity Policies, Laws, and Computer Crimes 2 1\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility 2 2\nTotal 18 14\nKnowledge Units"

It is important for students to\nrecognize that decisions in different contexts may require different ethical theories (including\ncombinations) to arrive at ethically acceptable outcomes, and what constitutes ‘acceptable’ depends on\n274\na variety of factors such as cultural context. Applying methods for ethical analysis requires both an\nunderstanding of the underlying principles and assumptions guiding a given tool and an awareness of\nthe social context for that decision. Traditional ethical frameworks (e.g., [11]) as provided by western\nphilosophy can be useful, but they are not all-inclusive. Effort must be taken to include decolonial,\nindigenous, and historically marginalized ethical perspectives whenever possible. No theory will be\nuniversally applicable to all contexts, nor is any single ethical framework the ‘best.’ Engagement across\nvarious ethical schools of thought is important for students to develop the critical thinking needed in\njudiciously applying methods for ethical analysis of a given situation."

These\nshifts require rethinking one’s entire approach to what is considered “professional”.\n286\n● Proactive: Students must be able to identify areas of importance (e.g., in accessibility and inclusion)\nand understand how to address them for a more professional working environment.\n● Culturally Competent: Students must prioritize cultural competence—the ability to work with people\nfrom cultures different from one’s own – by using inclusive language, watching for, and counteracting\nconscious and unconscious biases, and encouraging honest and open communication.\n● Advocative: Students must think, speak, and act in ways that foster and promote diversity, equity,\ninclusion, and accessibility in all ways including but not limited to teamwork, communication, and\nproduct development (hardware and software).\n● Responsible: Students must act responsibly in all areas of their work toward all users and\nstakeholders including the society at large, colleagues, and their profession in general.\nCourse Packaging Suggestions\nIn computing, societal and ethical considerations arise in all other knowledge areas and therefore\nshould arise in the context of other computing courses, not just siloed in an “SEP course.” These topics\nshould be covered in courses starting from the first year (the only likely exception is SEP-Ethical-\nAnalysis: Methods for Ethical Analysis) although this could be delivered as part of a first-year course or\nvia a seminar or an online independent study.\nPresenting SEP topics as advanced topics only covered in later courses could create the incorrect\nperception that SEP topics are only important at a certain level or complexity. While it is true that the\nimportance and consequence of SEP topics increases with level and complexity, introductory topics are\nnot devoid of SEP topics. Further, many SEP topics are best presented early to lay a foundation for\nmore intricate topics later in the curriculum.\nInstructor choice for some of these topics is complex. When SEP topics arise in other courses these\nare naturally often taught by the instructor teaching that course, although at times bringing in expert\neducators from other disciplines (e.g., law, ethics) could be advantageous. Stand-alone courses in SEP\n– should they be needed – are likely best delivered by an interdisciplinary team. However, this brings\nadditional complexity. Regardless, who teaches SEP topics and/or courses warrants careful\nconsideration.\nAt a minimum the SEP CS Core learning outcomes are best covered in the context of courses\ncovering other knowledge areas – ideally the SEP KA Core hours are also, with the likely\nexception of SEP-Ethical-Analysis. This knowledge unit (KU) underlies every other KU in the SEP\nknowledge area (KA). However, this KU is the only one in the SEP KA that does not readily lend itself\nto being taught in the context of other KAs. Delivering these topics warrants even more careful\nconsideration as to how/where they will be covered, and who will teach them. In conjunction with\ncovering SEP topics as they occur naturally in other KAs, dedicated SEP courses can add value.\nHowever, a sole, stand-alone course in a program where SEP topics are not covered in other courses\nshould be a last resort.\nAt some institutions, an in-depth dedicated course at the mid- or advanced-level may be offered\ncovering all recommended topics in both the CS Core and KA Core KUs in close coordination with\nlearning outcomes best covered in the context of courses covering other KAs. Such a course\ncould include:\n287\n● SEP-Context (5 hours)\n● SEP-Ethical-Analysis (3 hours)\n● SEP-Professional-Ethics (4 hours)\n● SEP-IP (2 hours)\n● SEP-Privacy (3 hours)\n● SEP-Communication (3 hours)\n● SEP-Sustainability (2 hours)\n● SEP-History (2 hours)\n● SEP-Economies (1 hour)\n● SEP-Security (3 hours)\n● SEP-DEIA (4 hours)\nSkill Statement\nA student who completes this course should be able to contribute to systemic change by applying\nsocietal and ethical knowledge using relevant underpinnings and frameworks to their work in the\ncomputing profession in a culturally competent manner including contributing to positive developments\nin inclusion, equity, diversity, and accessibility in computing.\nAt some institutions, a dedicated minimal course may be offered covering the CS Core knowledge\nunits in close coordination with learning outcomes best covered in the context of courses\ncovering other knowledge areas. Such a course could include:\n● SEP-Context (3 hours)\n● SEP-Ethical-Analysis (2 hours)\n● SEP-Professional-Ethics (2 hours)\n● SEP-IP (1 hour)\n● SEP-Privacy (2 hours)\n● SEP-Communication (2 hours)\n● SEP-Sustainability (1 hour)\n● SEP-History (1 hour)\n● SEP-Security (2 hours)\n● SEP-DEIA (2 hours)\nSkill Statement\nA student who completes this course should be able to apply societal and ethical knowledge to their\nwork in the computing profession while fostering and contributing to inclusion, equity, diversity, and\naccessibility in computing.\nSome Exemplary Materials\n● Emanuelle Burton, Judy Goldsmith, Nicholas Mattei, Cory Siler, and Sara-Jo Swiatek. 2023.\nTeaching Computer Science Ethics Using Science Fiction.

Computer systems have become a pillar of people's daily life. As such, it is essential for\nstudents to learn knowledge about computer systems, grasp the skills to use and design these\nsystems, and understand the fundamental rationale and principles in computer systems. It could equip\nstudents with the necessary competence for a career related to computer science.\nIn the curriculum of computer science, the study of computer systems typically spans multiple\nknowledge areas, including, but not limited to, operating systems, parallel and distributed systems,\ncommunications networks, computer architecture and organization, and software engineering. The\nSystem Fundamentals knowledge area, as suggested by its name, focuses on the fundamental\nconcepts and design principles in computer systems that are shared by these courses within their\nrespective cores. The goal of this knowledge area is to present an integrative view of these\nfundamental concepts and design principles in a unified albeit simplified fashion, providing a common\nfoundation for the different specialized mechanisms and policies appropriate to the specific domain\narea. The fundamental concepts in this knowledge area include an overview of computer systems,\nbasic concepts such as state and state transition, resource allocation and scheduling, and so on.\nMoreover, this knowledge area introduces basic design principles to improve the reliability, availability,\nefficiency, and security of computer systems.\nChanges since CS2013\nCompared to CS2013, the SF knowledge area incorporated significant changes to the knowledge units.\n• Added two new knowledge units: System Security and System Design.\n• Added a new knowledge unit named System Performance, which includes the topics from the\ndeprecated knowledge unit of Proximity and the deprecated knowledge unit of Virtualization and\nIsolation.\n• Added a new knowledge unit named Performance Evaluation, that includes the topics from the\ndeprecated unit of Evaluation and the deprecated unit of Quantitative Evaluation.\n• Renamed the Computational Paradigms knowledge unit to Overview of Computer Systems,\ndeprecated some topics in the unit, and added topics from the deprecated unit of Cross-Layer\nCommunications.\n• Renamed the State and State Machines knowledge unit to Basic Concepts and added topics such\nas finite state machines.\n• Deprecated the Cross-Layer Communications knowledge unit and moved parts of its topics to the\nunit of Overview of Computer Systems.\n• Deprecated the Evaluation and Quantitative Evaluation knowledge units and moved parts of their\ntopics to the unit of Performance Evaluation.\n• Deprecated the Proximity and Virtualization and Isolation knowledge units and moved parts of their\ntopics to the knowledge unit of System Performance.\n291\n• Deprecated the Parallelism knowledge unit and moved parts of its topic to the Basic Concepts\nknowledge unit.\n• Renamed the Reliability through Redundancy knowledge unit to System Reliability.\n• Added the Society, Ethics, and the Profession knowledge unit.\nCore Hours\nKnowledge Unit CS Core KA Core\nOverview of Computer Systems 3 0\nBasic Concepts 4 0\nResource Management 1 1\nSystem Performance 2 2\nPerformance Evaluation 2 2\nSystem Reliability 2 1\nSystem Security 2 1\nSystem Design 2 1\nSociety, Ethics, and Profession Included in SEP hours\nTotal 18 8\nKnowledge Units"

    "intro": "Despite being a creative, often highly compensated field with myriad job (and other) opportunities,\nracial, gender, and many other inequities in representation are pervasive in many regions. For too\nmany students, their first computer science course is their last. There are many factors including the\nlegacy of systemic racism, ableism, sexism, classism, and other injustices that contribute to the lack of\ndiverse identities within computer science, and there is no single or quick fix.\nCS2023’s sponsoring organizations are ACM, IEEE, and AAAI. Each of these places a high value on\ndiversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility; our computer science classrooms should promote and\nmodel those principles. We should welcome and seek diversity – the gamut of human differences\nincluding gender identity, ethnicity, race, politics, abilities and attributes, religion, nationality, etc.– in our\nclassrooms, departments, and campuses. We should strive to make our classrooms, labs, and curricula\naccessible and to promote inclusion. We should aim for students and all community members to have a\nsense of belonging that comes with being respected, wanted, and valued. To achieve equity, we must\nallocate resources, promote fairness, and check our biases to ensure persons of all identities achieve\nsuccess. Accessibility should be addressed and implemented in all computing activities and products.\nExplicitly infusing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) across the computer science\ncurriculum demonstrates its importance for the department, institution, and our field – all of which are\nlikely to have a DEIA statement and/or initiative(s). This emphasis on DEIA is important ethically and a\nbellwether issue of our time. Many professionals in computing already recognize attention to DEIA as\nintegral to disciplinary practice. Regardless of the degree to which these values appear in any one\ncomputer science class, research suggests that a lack of attention to them results in inferior designs in\naddition to harm and its perpetuation. Not only does data support that diverse teams outperform\nhomogeneous ones, but diverse teams may better prevent egregious technology failures in recent\nheadlines such as facial recognition misuse, airbag injuries and deaths, and other well-known failures\nof science and computing."

Pedagogical Considerations\n2. Curricular Practices in Computer Science\n3. Generative AI and the Curriculum\n407\n408\nPedagogical Considerations\nIntroduction\nWhat are some current trends in the teaching and learning of computer science? What are the\ncontroversies of the day in terms of the pedagogy of computer science education? In this section, a top\nfew trends, controversies, and challenges have been listed for each knowledge area as well as the\ncurriculum as a whole. These issues are expected to influence the future evolution of computer science\ncurricula.\nCurriculum-Wide Considerations\nThe adoption of CS2023’s recommendations presents numerous challenges at both the macro and the\nmicro level. Some of the macro considerations include the following.\n● Active learning is an important component of any computer science course – doing helps learn\ncomputer science. Courses that use interactive electronic resources (e.g., eBooks, python\nnotebooks) are a significant improvement over the traditional lecture-based courses that do not\ninvolve any active learning component – they provide ample opportunities to learn by solving\nproblems. In this regard, it is important to emphasize that ideally, active learning should cover the\nentire gamut of skill levels – not just apply, but also evaluate and develop.\n● The success of generative AI systems is causing faculty to reconsider their approach to\nassessment. Student grades are increasingly being based on in-class, closed-book assessments.\nCare should be taken not to lose sight of the objective of assessment when using expedient\nassessment techniques.\n● The landscape of computer science textbooks is in flux. The number of traditional publishing\nhouses is shrinking, the cost of their offerings is increasing, and the vast majority of these resources\nare primarily only in English – though generative AI systems are making important inroads in\nproviding accurate translations. Digital rentals, while cheaper, usually disappear at term’s end and\nare unavailable as future references. Open Educational Resources (OER) present a cost-effective\nalternative, but often lack formal review. Compounding this are students who, for financial and\ngenerational reasons, forgo acquiring the selected text(s) in favor of self-selected YouTube videos.\n● Broadening participation in computing is an ongoing concern in many contexts. Adopters of CS2023\nshould remain cognizant of how their curricular and pedagogical choices affect this important issue.\n● Studying abroad is a quintessential high impact learning experience. One potential impediment to\nits wide-spread adoption is curriculum design. This can include long prerequisite chains and dense\ncurricula. Care should be taken to leave room for, if not encouraged, penalty-free study abroad.\n409\nConsiderations by Knowledge Area\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\n● A balance must be struck between 1) the need to study fundamental issues of search and other\napproaches that are still in widespread use and 2) the desire to focus on cutting-edge AI and\nmachine learning methods.\n● Given AI’s current and future potential for societal impact, educators should ensure that all students\nare well-versed in the ethical and societal considerations and implications of applying AI methods.\n● Since AI is rapidly evolving as a field, it is challenging to create a curriculum that will remain current\nfor long. Consequently, the onus is on the instructors to keep up to date with current methods and\nuse their judgment in determining what to teach in order to keep their courses current.\nAlgorithmic Foundations (AL)\n● Should computer science graduates be able to explain, at some level, algorithmic approaches\nmaking headlines in the popular press, such as Blockchain, SHA-246, and Quantum Computing\nalgorithms? Topics focused on these, and other algorithms, received less than 50% support in the\ncommunity survey of Algorithmic Foundations area. Consequently, they were not listed as CS Core\ntopics. However, if computer science graduates are expected to explain these algorithms to non-\ntechnical members of the society, they should be exposed to these topics somewhere in the\ncurriculum.\n● Students are unlikely to implement a lot of historic algorithms in industry such as Bubble sort. A\nquestion that merits case-by-case consideration is whether these algorithms should be covered in\nthe curriculum and, if so, the level of skill at which they should be covered.\nArchitecture and Organization (AR)\n● Software tools for open hardware have lowered the cost and complexity of understanding the\ndesign of new processors. The community-driven RISC-V open instruction set architecture\n“democratizes” the design and evaluation of processors and presents a cutting-edge opportunity in\nthis regard.\n● Quantum Computing does not yet have a fully standardized interface between software and\nhardware. What should be the minimum set of Quantum Computing topics a computer science\ngraduate should be able to explain?\nData Management (DM)\n● For the most part, students write code that either reads/writes to a file or is interactive. Yet, in\nindustry, most data are obtained programmatically from a database. This is a source of mismatch\nbetween academic preparation and industry expectation.\n● Even though most databases are relational, NoSQL databases are enjoying a significant degree of\npopularity. Balancing the coverage of relational vs NoSQL databases is a concern for curricula.\n410\nFoundations of Programming Languages (FPL)\n● Shell scripting is a skill that students should master to automate laborious tasks. It is also a helpful\ntool to coordinate the work of multiple applications. An interesting curricular exercise is determining\nhow and when to teach it as a paradigm.\n● There is an increasing need to develop large, complex software systems that have the potential for\ncatastrophic failure (e.g., software driving medical devices such as robotic surgery). Such software\nneeds to have its behavior validated and potentially formally proved correct. As a result, formal\nmethods may be more important in the future. This would require greater mathematical skills and\nability in graduates.\nMathematical and Statistical Foundations (MSF)\nFaculty and students alike have strong opinions about how much and what mathematics should be\nincluded in the CS curriculum. Generally, faculty, who themselves have strong theoretical training, are\ntypically concerned about poor student preparation and motivation to learn mathematics, while students\ncomplain about not seeing applications and wonder what any of the mathematics has to do with the\nsoftware jobs they seek. Even amongst faculty, there is recurring debate on whether calculus should be\nrequired of computer science students, especially in light of the impact calculus failure rates have on\nbroadening participation. Yet, at the same time, the discipline has itself undergone a significant\nmathematical change – machine learning, robotics, data science, and quantum computing all demand a\ndifferent kind of mathematics than is typically covered in a standard discrete structures course. The\ncombination of changing mathematical demands and inadequate student preparation or motivation, in\nan environment of enrollment-driven strain on resources, has become a key challenge for CS\ndepartments. Some recommendations that have been presented for the treatment of mathematics in\ncomputer science programs follow.\n● Requiring PreCalculus as a prerequisite for discrete mathematics will ensure that students enter\ncomputer science with some degree of comfort with symbolic mathematics and functions.\n● Studies show that students are motivated when they see applications of mathematics. It is\nrecommended that minor programming assignments and demonstrations of applications of\nmathematics be included in computer science courses.\n● Institutions should adopt preparatory options to ensure sufficient background without lowering\nstandards in mathematics. Theory courses can be moved further back in the curriculum to\naccommodate first-year preparation. Where possible, institutions can offer online self-paced tutoring\nsystems alongside regular coursework.\n● What is clear, when looking forward to the next decade, is that exciting high-growth areas of\ncomputer science will require a strong background in linear algebra, probability, and statistics\n(preferably calculus-based). And as much of this material as possible should be included in the\nstandard curriculum.\n● Educators and institutions are often under pressure to help every student succeed, many of whom\nstruggle with mathematics. While pathways, including computer science-adjacent degrees or tracks,\nare sometimes created to steer students around mathematics requirements towards software-\nfocused careers, educators should be equally direct in explaining the importance of sufficient\nmathematical preparation for graduate school and for the very topical areas that excite students.\n411\nThe better approach is to invest in remediation courses to sufficiently prepare as many students as\npossible.\nNetworking and Communication (NC)\n● To what extent should students learn the very low-level details associated with networking or should\nhigher levels of abstraction be the norm in teaching?\n● Cutting-edge technologies promise to significantly affect networking. Generative AI might benefit\nthe generation of networked configurations, security assessments, and capacity planning. Quantum\ncomputing may significantly affect the teaching and practice of networking. And the same goes for\nemerging communication technologies like 5G.\nOperating Systems (OS)\n● How do we teach operating systems as a cohesive set of functions when OS functions are\nincreasingly embedded in architectures or distributed within software development frameworks?\n● Educators should continue to emphasize the importance of operating systems knowledge in\ndistributed, parallel, and secure applications.\n● Is there value in having students recreate operating system functions as a pedagogical approach or\nshould the focus be on a student’s ability to reason about the performance of off-the-shelf library\nmodules that compose applications?\nParallel and Distributed Computing (PDC)\n● Should parallel and distributed programming be infused across a curriculum?\nSoftware Development Fundamentals (SDF)\n● Students will still need to be able to produce code. How they go about doing so may change rapidly\nand dramatically with improvements in the capabilities of generative AI. Students should also be\nable to read, critique, and verify the correctness of code — abilities that students will need if\ngenerative AI is used to write code.\n● Assessment practices in introductory programming courses will need to be adapted to take into\naccount the availability of generative AI. How remains to be seen. It is foreseeable that currently\npopular assessment approaches such as drill-and-practice, many-small-problems, and written\nExplain in Plain English (EiPE) assessments, will need to change or be utilized differently. A focus\non what today would be considered ‘alternative’ means of assessment may rise in prominence—for\ninstance, oral examination, code modification, and other difficult-to-accomplish (with generative AI)\nassessment schemes.\n● High-level approaches to teaching and learning introductory programming may need to be\ndramatically rethought. Approaches similar to studio models of learning from the fine arts where\nstudents design, show, explain, and critique work made in the studio are a way to engage students\nwith topics that let them express their own ideas and vision while learning about fundamental topics.\n412\n● The order in which Software Development Fundamentals (SDF) topics are discussed may need to\nbe reconsidered. For instance, starting with syntax and creating increasingly complex programs\nfrom scratch may be replaced by concepts-first approaches where modularity is considered from\nthe beginning, and syntax and other more basic constructs such as conditionals and repetition are\nlearned during the process.\n● New skills such as prompting (prompt engineering) and the use of other generative AI tool\nrequirements/features may in the near future be considered to be basic programming skills. How\nthe industry adopts generative AI may be a leading driver in such arenas.\nSoftware Engineering (SE)\n● Are undergraduate programs in computing that rely on a single team project beneficial? Teamwork\nis ubiquitous in industry, but no teams are formed entirely out of people with similar backgrounds\nwho have no prior experience working on a team. The heterogeneous background and experience\nlevel of real teams is fundamentally different from the comparative homogeneity of students in a\nclass.\n● Do students have sufficient opportunity to practice with open-ended problems, where the choice of\ntools and approach are critical? In a software engineering context, most work involves evaluating\ntradeoffs – between space and time, between speed-of-implementation and runtime optimization,\nbetween Do-it-Yourself (DIY) and Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) or Open-Source Software\n(OSS) approaches. Are students given enough opportunities to practice the critical decision-making\nskills necessary to succeed in a professional environment?\n● Software developed in a team setting (software engineering rather than programming) is more likely\nto have an impact on society for good or ill. At the same time, teamwork means no single person\nmay be responsible for the impact of the software—the larger the project, the greater the potential\nimpact, but the less responsible any team member feels about the impact. How do we instill among\nstudents a proper sense of responsibility for the whole solution regardless of the size of one’s\ncontribution to it?\n● Formal methods for software validation will pay off (substantially) later in students’ careers, but it is\na perfect-but-infrequent solution. The current approach to validation focuses on attempts to get\nhigh-fidelity evidence (unit tests) over proofs and other formal methods, which is more immediately\nuseful but fails to expose students to interesting long-term ideas. Given the finite resources\nprovided for software engineering education, educators must strike the right balance between these\ntwo approaches.\nSecurity (SEC)\n● An ongoing pedagogical consideration is inculcating a security mindset among students, so that\nsecurity is a goal from the start and not an afterthought.\nSociety, Ethics, and the Profession (SEP)\n● Is an introduction to ethical thinking and an awareness of social issues and their emerging\nprofessional responsibilities sufficient for our graduates to act ethically and responsibly? If not, does\nthat put the burden on instructors to not only lead discussion about the pressing questions of the\n413\nday but also weigh in on those matters? How should that be done? Will we just be imparting our\nown biases upon our students? Should this be avoided? If so, how?\n● CS curricula regularly require prerequisite courses in mathematics. Should there be parallel\nprerequisite requirements in moral philosophy to prepare students for future course work in\nperforming ethical analysis?\n● How could we weave SEP throughout the curriculum in practice? Is this realistic? How much\ncoordination would it take? How less optimal is it to have a standalone ethics course only? Is there\nanother model in between these two extremes (neglecting the extreme of not having any\ncoordinated or targeted SEP content in our courses)?\n● Educators naturally possess real or perceived authority when it comes to technical issues. Many\neducators believe they lack this authority when it comes to SEP topics. How can CS instructors be\nempowered to effectively incorporate SEP topics into their courses?\n● How can we effectively impart the core values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility? How\nis this best done in a computer science context? How can we effectively impart the core values and\nskills of being a computing professional into our students’ education? Are engineered “toy” projects\na suitable context for these? Are study abroad opportunities/work-placements/internships better?\nAre they worth the cost? Should we put more focus on efforts to have more programs/degrees\ncontain study abroad opportunities/placements/internships?\n● Should software developers be licensed like engineers, architects, and medical practitioners? This\nis an older debate but given the impact of software systems (akin to safe bridges, buildings, etc.),\nmaybe it is time to revisit this question.\n● What would a set of current SEP case studies look like and how could they be employed\neffectively?\n● How can collateral learning be leveraged to improve the learning and appreciation of societal,\nethical, and professional topics?\nSpecialized Platform Development (SPD)\n● Computing is no longer limited to traditional desktop applications. Students need to learn how to\ndevelop software solutions for various platforms, including web, mobile, IoT devices, and emerging\nplatforms like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). A well-rounded curriculum should\nprovide opportunities for learning on multiple platforms.\n● With the increasing demand for cross-platform apps, educators should teach students how to\ndevelop applications that work seamlessly across different operating systems and devices using\ntechnologies such as React Native, Flutter, or Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).\n● Cloud platforms and services, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, have become integral to\nmodern platform development. Students need to learn how to deploy, scale, and manage\napplications in the cloud.\nSystems Fundamentals (SF)\n● How deeply should instructors elaborate on the design principles of computer systems in\nundergraduate courses?\n414\n● What role should generative AI play in system-related knowledge areas, not only systems\nfundamentals, but also architecture and organization, network and communication, operating\nsystems, and parallel and distributed computing?\n● Should instructors link knowledge units from systems-related knowledge areas with those from\napplications-related knowledge areas? And if so, how?\n415\n416\nCurricular Practices in Computer Science\nIntroduction\nPrior curricular guidelines enumerated issues in the design and delivery of computer science\ncurriculum. Given the increased importance of these issues, in CS2023, peer-reviewed, well-\nresearched, in-depth articles were solicited from recognized experts on how computer science\neducators could address these issues in their teaching practices. These articles complement the\nCS2023 curricular guidelines. Whereas curricular guidelines list what should be covered in the\ncurriculum, these articles describe how and why they could best be covered, including challenges, state\nof the art practices, etc.\nThe articles may be categorized as covering the following.\n● Social aspects, including teaching about accessibility, computer science for social good,\nresponsible computing, and ethics in the global souths.\n● Pedagogical considerations, including CS + X, the role of formal methods in computer science,\nquantum computing education, and the impact of generative AI on programming instruction.\n● Educational practices, in varied settings such as liberal arts institutions, community colleges, and\npolytechnic institutes.\nThe articles provide a “lay of the land,” a snapshot of the current state of the art of computer science\neducation. They are not meant to advocate specific approaches or viewpoints, but rather help computer\nscience educators weigh their options and make informed decisions about the appropriate option for\ntheir degree program.\nThe computer science education community was invited to provide feedback and suggestions on the\nfirst drafts of most of these articles. Several of the articles have been or are in the process of being\npublished in peer-reviewed conferences and journals. In this section, self-contained summaries of most\nof the articles have been included. The full articles themselves will be accessible at the csed.acm.org\nwebsite.\nIn addition, to globalize computer science education, articles were also invited on educational practices\nin various parts of the world. (See ACM Inroads, Special Issue, 15, 1 (March 2024)). It is hoped that\nthese articles will foster mutual understanding and exchange of ideas, engender transnational\ncollaboration and student exchange, and serve to integrate computer science education at the global\nlevel through shared understanding of its challenges and opportunities.\nSocial Aspects\nAccessibility is about making computing systems accessible to people with disabilities and designing\ntechnical solutions for accessibility problems faced by people with disabilities. The article “Teaching\n417\nabout Accessibility in Computer Science Education” explains the practical, intellectual, and social\nreasons for integrating accessibility into the computer science curriculum.\nThe article “Computing for Social Good in Education” highlights how computing education can be\nused to improve society and address societal needs while also providing authentic computing\nenvironments in education. The authors discuss approaches, challenges, and benefits of incorporating\ncomputing for social good into computer science curriculum.\nGiven the pervasive use of computing in society, educators would be remiss not to teach their students\nabout the principles of responsible computing. How they should go about doing so is explored in the\narticle “Multiple Approaches for Teaching Responsible Computing.” It uses research in the social\nsciences and humanities to transform responsible computing into an integrated consideration of values\nthroughout the lifecycle of computing products.\nIn a globalized world, applications of computing transcend national borders. In this context, making\nethics at home in global computer science education is about helping students relate to values within\nand beyond their own contexts. The article “Making Ethics at Home in Global CS Education:\nProvoking Stories from the Souths” presents storytelling as a mechanism that educators can use to\nengage students with “ethos building.”\nPedagogical Considerations\n“CS + X: Approaches, Challenges, and Opportunities in Developing Interdisciplinary Computing\nCurricula” states how interdisciplinary majors that apply computational methods in natural sciences,\nsocial sciences, humanities, and the arts can broaden participation in computing and reach a larger\ngroup of students.\n“The Role of Formal Methods in Computer Science Education” makes the case for incorporating\nformal methods in computer science education. It lists the multiple ways in which formal methods can\nbe incorporated into the undergraduate computer science curriculum and buttresses its advocacy of\nformal methods with testimonials from the industry.\n“Quantum Computing Education: A Curricular Perspective” presents the current state of art in\nquantum computing and uses the results of a pedagogic experiment to illustrate that quantum\ncomputing education is within reach of even school children. It presents three curricular approaches for\nincorporating quantum computing in undergraduate computer science curriculum.\n“Generative AI in Introductory Programming” explores how generative AI tools based on Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT might affect programming education including how these\ntools can be used to assess student work, provide feedback, and to act as always-available virtual\nteaching assistants in introductory programming courses.\nOne issue with the study of databases/data management is that the number of possible topics far\nexceeds the bandwidth of a single undergraduate computer science course. “The 2022 Undergraduate\n418\nDatabase Course in Computer Science: What to Teach?” presents multiple viewpoints on what a\nsingle undergraduate course in Databases/Data Management should cover.\nEducational Practices\nNo curricular guidelines are complete by themselves. They must be adapted to local strengths,\nconstraints, and needs. In this regard, “Computer science Curriculum Guidelines: A New Liberal\nArts Perspective” provides a process to adapt CS2023 to the needs of liberal arts colleges that\nconstrain the size of the computer science coursework in order to expose students to a broad range of\nliberal arts subjects.\nCommunity and polytechnic colleges across the world offer specialized programs that help students\nfocus on specific educational pathways. They award academic degrees that enable students to transfer\nto four-year colleges and are attuned to the needs of the local workforce. “Computer Science\nEducation in Community Colleges” presents the context and perspective of community college\ncomputer science education.\n419\nTeaching about Accessibility in Computer Science Education\nRichard E. Ladner, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA\nStephanie Ludi, University of North Texas, Denton, TX, USA\nRobert J. Domanski, Hunter College (CUNY), New York, NY, USA\nAccessibility, in the context of computer science, is about making computing products accessible to\npeople with disabilities. This means designing hardware and software products that can be used\neffectively by people who have difficulty reading a computer screen, hearing computer prompts, or\ncontrolling the keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen. Thus, accessibility topics should be woven into any\ncourse about human-facing applications or websites, such as app and web design/development,\nsoftware engineering, and human-computer interaction. In addition, accessibility is about creating\ntechnical solutions to accessibility problems that people with disabilities encounter in everyday living.\nThese technical solutions may include the use of artificial intelligence, computer vision, natural\nlanguage processing, or other CS topics. Thus, accessibility topics can be included in technical\ncourses, particularly those that incorporate projects where students attempt to solve accessibility\nproblems using techniques taught in the course. There are practical, intellectual, and social reasons to\nintegrate accessibility into computer science curriculum. From a practical standpoint, employers\nincreasingly include accessibility knowledge in job descriptions because they want their products and\nservices to be accessible to more customers and for legal compliance. From an intellectual standpoint,\ntechnical solutions to many accessibility problems often require creativity and a multi-disciplinary\napproach that includes understanding user needs integrated with technical knowledge. From a social\nstandpoint, accessibility is an important topic in addressing inclusivity and an attractive topic for those\nstudents who enter the field to do social good, leading to a broader mix of students in terms of gender,\nrace, ethnicity, and ability.\nHelpful Resources:\n[1] Catherine Caldwell-Harris, & Chloe Jordan. 2014.

Incorporating CSG into education\n(CSG-Ed) is especially relevant as computing has more and more impact across all areas of society\nand daily life. Educators can address CSG-Ed through a variety of means [2]. A simple way to start is\nby modifying a single assignment within a single course by updating the domain of the assignment to\nbe one with social impact. The use of this domain can then be expanded across several assignments\nwithin the same course or across several courses. The domain could also provide the opportunity for\ncollaborations across related departments. Indeed, some countries, such as England, integrate CSG\nthroughout the curriculum starting before higher education studies [6].\nAnother way that educators may support CSG-Ed is the adoption or creation of a classroom project that\nsolves a social problem either for a campus organization or from the larger community [1]. This\napproach allows students to see the impact of their work within their own community. On a larger scale,\nparticipation in established projects with national or global scope allows students to understand the\nbreadth of influence that computing can have. Such efforts align well with institutions that have a\nservice-learning requirement [4]. In addition, hackathons, code-days, clubs, and other extracurricular\nactivities allow students to understand the social impact of computing outside of the classroom.\nThere are several challenges to integrating computing for social good into higher education [3]. One\nchallenge is that instructors may not be inclined to incorporate new topics fearing that it could disrupt\nthe curriculum or require course rework. Instructor time is a second barrier where it may take time to\nunderstand CSG domains and create new assignments. The interdisciplinary nature of many CSG\ntopics may also require collaborating with other departments, disciplines, or community partners\nresulting in additional course preparation time. CSG-Ed assignments may result in the discussion of\nsocial issues within the classroom that could require instructors to prepare to discuss these issues with\nstudents. In addition, there appears to be a shortage of coverage of CSG in textbooks.\nWhile barriers to CSG-Ed adoption exist, this focus of computing education provides multiple\nopportunities. CSG-Ed provides the possibility for students to connect with real-world problems to\nunderstand the complexity of computing while also apprehending the social impact of computing [5].\nStudents can be motivated by engaging in solving local problems that directly impact themselves or\ntheir community. They can also gain a better understanding of global citizenship and responsibility by\nparticipating in social projects that have a global scale.\n422\nThere are several areas of future investigation including creation of a repository of CSG-Ed materials,\naddressing project-related challenges, exploring open source in CSG-Ed, and approaches for creating\nand growing an inclusive community to support CSG-Ed.\nReferences\n[1] Grant Braught, Steven Huss-Lederman, Stoney Jackson, Wes Turner, and Karl R.

Doore, Colby College, Waterville, ME, USA\nAtri Rudra, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA\nMichelle Trim, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA\nJoycelyn Streator, Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, TX, USA & the Mozilla Foundation\nRichard Blumenthal, Regis University, Colorado, CO, USA\nBobby Schnabel, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA\nTeaching applied ethics in computer science (and computing in general) has shifted from a perspective\nof teaching about professional codes of conduct and an emphasis on risk management towards a\nbroader understanding of the impacts of computing on humanity and the environment. This shift has\nproduced a diversity of approaches for integrating responsible computing instruction into core computer\nscience knowledge areas and for an expansion of dedicated courses focused on computing ethics.\nThere is an increased recognition that students need intentional and consistent opportunities\nthroughout their computer science education to develop the critical thinking, analytical reasoning, and\ncultural competency skills to understand their roles and professional duties in the responsible design,\nimplementation, and management of complex computing systems. Therefore, computing education\nprograms are re-evaluating the ways in which students learn to identify and assess the impact of\ncomputing on individuals, communities, and societies along with other critical professional skills such as\neffective communication, workplace conduct, and regulatory responsibilities. One of the primary shifts\nin the new approach comes from interdisciplinary collaborations, combining computing, social sciences\nand humanities researchers who work together to help students identify potential biases, blind spots,\nimpacts, and harms in applications or systems and examine underlying assumptions and competing\nvalues driving design decisions.\nThere are examples of how topics within the CS2023 Society, Ethics, and the Profession (SEP)\nknowledge area can be implemented and assessed with numerous links to current module repositories\n[1-6], lessons [7-11], and resources [12-21] to embed responsible computing teaching across the CS\ncurriculum. There are specific recommendations and resources that will help address current barriers\nfor moving forward with the integration of responsible computing practices in the classroom [22]. These\ninclude ways of being open and confident in honoring all students’ prior knowledge and lived\nexperiences in sometimes difficult conversations [23-24] and overcoming student apathy or resistance\nto embedding responsible computing content [25-26]. These strategies require a willingness to work\nwithin an interdisciplinary community to incorporate social science and humanities domain expertise\nwithin these classroom interactions [27-29]. There are also recommendations on how to bring\nundergraduate students into curriculum planning as many of the earliest responsible computing\nteaching models were co-developed with undergraduate CS students [30-32]. Finally, there are\nrecommendations about distinguishing between often conflated concepts, associated with responsible\ncomputing such as social justice [33-35], trust and safety [36-38], and value-sensitive design and co-\ndesign [39-40]. The understanding and use of these principles and practices in the classroom\ncommunicate the importance of stakeholder groups and impacted community inclusion from the\nbeginning of the technology development lifecycle and affirms the agentive role of that community in\ndevelopment decisions. We hope this contribution will assist instructors as they develop their learning\n424\nobjectives, activities, and assessments while adding to the growing body of knowledge on the best\npractices for weaving responsible computing principles and content throughout the evolving\nACM/IEEE/AAAI computing curricula.\nReferences\n[1] ACM Engage CSEdu Ethics Repository. https://www.engage-csedu.org/ethics-and-\ncomputing/repository.

Bidwell, Charles Darwin University and University of Melbourne, Australia, International\nUniversity of Management, Namibia\nWe, a group of thirteen educators in computing programs and researchers in universities, retell the\nstories of 46 university educators and practitioners in Latin America, South-Asia, Africa, the Middle\nEast, and Australian First Nations who participated in surveys and interviews with us [1]. We use the\nplural of Global Souths to indicate the multiple and overlapping geographic and conceptual spaces that\nare negatively impacted by contemporary capitalist globalization and the US–European norms and\nvalues exported in computing products, processes, and education. The stories illustrate frictions\nbetween local practices, values, and impacts of technologies and the static, anticipatory approaches to\nethics that computer science (CS) curricula often promote through codes of ethics. The stories show\ndiverse perspectives on privacy and institutional approaches to confidentiality; compliance with\nregulations to attain various goals and difficulties when regulations are absent or ambiguously relate to\npractices; discrimination based on their gender or technical ability and minoritized positions; and, finally,\nthat relational, rather than transactional, approaches to ethics may better suit local ethical challenges.\nCS codes of ethics can assist educators by listing factors for consideration and mitigating situations\nwhen regulations, laws or policies are not fully developed. Yet the gap between codes of ethics and\nlocal realities can also cause harm. Further prevalent codes of ethics are instruments of power that\nenable actors in the Global North to determine what legitimate CS practice comprises and the position\nof the Global Souths relative to this. Thus, we advocate for ethical guidance that speaks to and comes\n“from within” people’s messy realities in the Global Souths not only because connecting ethics to\nstudents’ and educators’ values, knowledge, and experiences is vital for learning but also to assert\ngreater recognition and respect for localized ethical judgements.\nMaking ethics at home in global CS education is about fostering students’ ethical sensibilities and\norienting them to engage reflexively with different values and positionalities within and beyond their own\ncontexts. Ethical considerations are always updating as new technologies, new socio-technical\nsituations and new sensitivities emerge and, thus, we suggest that educators use storytelling about\n429\nongoing, real-world events to engage students with “ethos building.” [2] In the epilogue that extends this\npiece [3], we share two stories that arose when researching and presenting this article to show how\nethics is embedded in every action and how as educators we must continuously refine our sensitivity to\nthe varied ways our lives are implicated in technical and socio-technical systems, from local to global\nscales, and develop confidence to discuss their implications with our students.\nOur modest study significantly extends existing research [1] on how CS educators account for the\ndiverse ways ethical dilemmas and approaches to ethics are situated in cultural, philosophical, and\ngovernance systems, religions, and languages [1].\nReferences\n[1] Janet Hughes, Ethan Plaut, Feng Wang, Elizabeth von Briesen, Cheryl Brown, Gerry Cross, Viraj\nKumar, and Paul Myers.

Gunter, UIUC, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA\nMark Guzdial, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA\nRan Libeskind-Hadas, Claremont McKenna College, Claremont, CA, USA\nBill Manaris, College of Charleston, Charleston, SC, USA\nInterdisciplinary computing curricula and majors (often called CS+X) interweave foundational\ncomputing concepts with those of specific disciplines in the natural sciences, social sciences,\nhumanities, and the arts. Well-designed CS+X programs have substantially increased diversity and\ninclusion in computing. They address a rapidly growing need for a computationally sophisticated\nworkforce across many domains that are critical to society. Virtually every discipline has significant\nchallenges and opportunities that require computational methods. Increasingly, many researchers and\npractitioners in those fields are using computational methods, yet undergraduates in those fields often\nget little or no computational training deeper than using existing software tools.\nInterdisciplinary computing can be implemented in individual courses (e.g., a course that combines both\nthe art and computing concepts for visualization); as a major+minor; or as its own major, where\nstudents take some courses from computing, a similar number from another discipline, and one or more\nintegrative courses.\nInterdisciplinary courses and majors have several additional benefits. There is ample evidence that\nsuch innovative programs significantly broaden participation in computing. For example,\ninterdisciplinary programs can substantially improve gender diversity and, generally, engage diverse\npopulations of students who are unlikely to pursue a within-discipline computing degree [1,2,3,4]. The\ngender diversity likely depends in part on the X in CS+X. For example, at some institutions with CS+X\nprograms where X is related to the arts, the CS+X major has approximately equal numbers of women\nand men, which is more than twice the national statistic for CS programs (22% women).\nA second benefit of interdisciplinary computing majors is the ability to reach a larger set of students –\nbecause of enrollment pressures and course caps in computer science departments, non-majors are\noften unable to access the computing courses that they seek. CS+X majors can help computing\ndepartments (and universities) better manage enrollments. A CS+X major typically will require fewer\ncomputing classes than a within-discipline CS major, reducing enrollment pressure on higher-level\nelectives that are often harder to staff.\nReferences\n[1] William Bares, Bill Manaris, and Renée McCauley.

These methods provide a systematic demonstration to students of the\napplication of formal foundations in Computer Science within engineering tasks. The core skill of\nabstraction, fundamental to computer science, is effectively addressed through FM [1]. Even students\nspecializing in 'Formal Methods Thinking'—the application of ideas from FM in informal, lightweight,\npractical, and accessible ways—experience notable improvement in their programming skills [2].\nExposure to these ideas also positions students well for further study on why techniques work, how\nthey can be automated, and the development of new approaches.\nFM can contribute significantly to teaching programming to novices, complementing informal reasoning\nand testing methods. They elucidate algorithmic problem-solving, design patterns, model-driven\nengineering, software architecture, software product lines, requirements engineering, and security,\nthereby supporting various fields within computer science [3]. Formalisms provide a concise and\nprecise means of expressing underlying design principles, equipping programmers with tools to\naddress related problems.\nIn industry, FM find widespread application, from eliciting requirements and early design to deployment,\nconfiguration, and runtime monitoring [4]. A recent survey [5] involving 130 FM experts, including three\nTuring Award winners, all four FME Fellowship Award winners, and 16 CAV Award winners, indicates\nthat the most suitable place for FM in a teaching curriculum is in bachelor courses at the university\nlevel, as reported by 79.2% of respondents. Furthermore, 71.5% of respondents identify the lack of\nproper training in FM among engineers as the key limiting factor for a broader adoption of FM by the\nindustry.\nThe survey highlights the uneven nature of FM education across universities, with many experts\nadvocating for the standardization of university curricula. A recent white paper [6] supports this view,\nproposing the inclusion of a compulsory FM course in Computer Science and Software Engineering\ncurricula. This recommendation is based on the observation that there is a shortage of Computer\nScience graduates qualified to apply Formal Methods in industry.\nThe challenge is twofold: (1) the lack of definitive educational sources that support FM-based courses\nin Computer Science; and (2) the training of academic staff to teach FM. Help is, however, becoming\navailable (https://fmeurope.org/teaching/), and the future is bright, as more and more educators\ncontribute to the effort of creating and sharing teaching resources.\n433\nReferences\n[1] Manfred Broy, Achim D.

The term (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) was\nintroduced by John Preskill at Q2B in December 2017. Atom Computing first reached 1,000 qubits in\n2013 [9], soon thereafter followed by IBM [10]. The milestone marks just how far the industry has come:\nonly 6 years ago, typically, under 10 qubits were available for developers on the IBM Quantum\nExperience. Long-time quantum pioneer D-Wave remains an outlier in that it has a 5,000-qubit system\n(Advantage) but it is an analog, not a gate-based system; it is an open question whether gate-based\napproaches are necessary to get the full power of fault-tolerant quantum computing and D-Wave has\nrecently started developing gate-based technology. On the other hand, adiabatic quantum computing\n(AQC) and quantum annealing (QA) remain legitimate (and promising) avenues of research in quantum\ncomputation. Also, this year, a Harvard-led team developed the first-ever quantum circuit with logical\nquantum bits [1]. Arrays of “noisy” physical Rydberg qubits were used to create quantum circuits with\n48 error-correcting logical qubits, the largest number to date, a crucial step towards realizing fault-\ntolerant quantum computing. Meanwhile, PsiQuantum continues to pursue unabated the 1,000,000\n(physical) qubits mark [7,8]. The competition between the various qubit implementation modalities\nintensified: superconducting qubits, trapped atoms/ions, spin qubits (Intel has a 12-qubit chip) and\nphotonics are currently in the lead. Debates [6] now abound about the potential (or impending) demise\nof the NISQ era. The industry remains engaged in a sustained effort of both short-term (upskilling and\nreskilling workers, and HS teachers) and long-term workforce development. This past summer,\nresearchers at Quantinuum and Oxford University [2,11] established the foundations and methodology\nfor an ongoing educational experiment to investigate the question: ‘From what age can students learn\nquantum theory if taught using a diagrammatic approach?' The math-free framework in [3] was used to\nteach the pictorial method to UK schoolchildren, who then beat the average exam scores of Oxford\nUniversity’s postgraduate physics students. The experiment involved 54 schoolchildren, aged 15-17,\nrandomly selected from around 1,000 applicants, from 36 UK schools (mostly state schools).\nTeenagers spent two hours a week in online classes and after eight weeks were given a test using\nquestions taken from past Oxford postgraduate quantum exams: more than 80% of the pupils passed\nand around half earned a distinction. Interest in incorporating quantum architecture topics in the\ntraditional CS curriculum remains high for the next 10-year horizon. A growing consensus is that the CS\nundergraduate must have a proper appreciation for the quantum mechanical nature of our world. The\nmain prerequisite to such a knowledge unit remains a certain intellectual versatility, manifested in the\nwillingness to be exposed to information from more than one domain/discipline. In quantum computing,\nlabs will be quintessential and will rely on (1) computer-assisted mathematics (e.g., Wolfram Alpha,\nNumPy, Qiskit, Matplotlib, etc.) as well as CAD/CAM and advanced software emulation (Qiskit Metal),\n(2) access to actual quantum computers via various cloud platforms (Amazon Braket, IBM Q, Xanadu\nBorealis, etc.) and (3) occasionally access to a physics lab, fab or foundry. A genuinely interdisciplinary\nprogram can only be built if faculty have wide general support towards such a goal. Three curricular\napproaches have emerged: one is entirely without math but leading into math and lasts about eight\nweeks. The second is a full semester, 14-week long, and entirely based on linear algebra. The last one\n435\nis two semesters long and includes weekly, messy but critical, quantum hardware labs supporting a\nquantum engineering degree. Incorporating material about all qubit modalities in the curriculum will\nensure the material will remain relevant over a reasonably long period of time, if it includes such topics\nas the design and implementation of qubits (e.g., via Qiskit Metal) and error mitigation and (classical)\ncontrol.\nReferences\n[1] D.

They can often\nproduce syntactically and logically correct code from natural language prompts that rival the\nperformance of high-performing introductory programming students—an ability that has already been\nshown to extend beyond introductory programming [2]. However, their impact in the classroom goes\nbeyond producing code. For example, they could help level the playing field between students with and\nwithout prior experience. Generative AI tools have been shown to be proficient in not only explaining\nprogramming error messages but in repairing broken code [6], and pair programming might evolve from\ntwo students working together into “me and my AI.” On the other hand they could have negative effects.\nStudents could become over-reliant on them, and they may open up new divides due to different\nbackgrounds, experience levels and access issues [9]. Generative AI has been successful in\ngenerating novel exercises and examples including providing correct solutions and functioning test\ncases [11]. Instructional materials are already being produced including a textbook that uses\nGenerative AI from the first day of CS1 [8] that has already been used [4]. Given their ability to provide\ncode explanations [7] they have the potential to assess student work, provide feedback, and to act as\nalways-available virtual teaching assistants, easing the burden not only on the educator but on their\nhuman assistants and the broader educational systems where learning takes place [9]. Generative AI\ncould even affect student intakes given its prominence in the media and the effect that such forces can\nhave on who chooses to—and who chooses not to—study computing.\nGiven that Generative AI has the potential to reshape introductory programming, it is possible that it will\nimpact the entire computing curriculum, affecting what is taught, when it is taught, how it is taught, and\nto whom it is taught. However, the dust is far from settled on these matters with some educators\nembracing Generative AI and others very fearful that the challenges could outweigh the opportunities\n[5]. The computing education community needs to understand more about how students interact with\nGenerative AI [10] and provide tooling and strategies to effectively achieve that interaction [3]. Indeed,\nduring the transformation from pre- to post-Generative AI introductory programming, several issues\nneed to be mitigated including but certainly not limited to those of ethics, bias, academic integrity, and\nbroadening participation in computing [1]. Further study is warranted to explore the long-term effects of\n438\nGenerative AI on pedagogy, curriculum, student demographics, and the broader educational\necosystem.\nReferences\n[1] Brett A.

Raj, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA\nMohamed Mokbel, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA\nOne issue with the study of databases, though maybe it should be labeled data management, or maybe\neven more precisely, the study of persistent data, is that the number of possible topics far exceeds the\nbandwidth of a single undergraduate CS course. Yes, there are several institutions with two course\nsequences. However, most undergraduate curricula, based on CS2013 [2] recommendations or ABET\n[1] criteria, have at most one database course, or just an elective. So, the question arises as to what to\ninclude and what to exclude.\nContributing to this phenomenon are the emergence of new topics (e.g., NoSQL, distributed and cloud-\nbased databases) and the current renewed (and hopefully continuing) emphasis on both security and\nprivacy, as well as societal and ethical issues associated with persistent data.\nAnother complicating factor is the institutional context. Every institution's curricular viewpoint sits\nsomewhere on the spectrum between computer science as a pure science and computer science as a\nprofession. Institutions are now preparing graduates for careers as Data Engineers, Data Infrastructure\nEngineers, and Data Scientists, in addition to Computer Scientists.\nThere are four primary perspectives with which to approach databases.\n1. Database designers/modelers: those who model the data from an enterprise and organize it\naccording to the principles of a given data model.\n2. Database users: (SQL?) query writers.\n3. Database administrators: those involved with tuning database performance through the building of\nindex structures and the setting of various parameters.\n4. Database engine developers: those who write the code for database engines.\nFour different viewpoints for what an undergraduate CS course in Databases/Data Management should\ncover are described in [3].\nReferences\n[1] ABET (2022).

Liberal arts CS programs often struggle to apply these guidelines within their institutional\nand departmental contexts [6]. Historically, this has been addressed through the development of model\nCS curricula tailored for the liberal arts context [1,2,3,4,7]. We take a different position: that no single\nmodel curriculum can apply across the wide range of liberal arts institutions. Instead, we argue that\nliberal arts CS educators need best practices for using guidelines such as CS2023 to inform curriculum\ndesign. These practices must acknowledge the opportunities and priorities of a liberal arts philosophy\nas well as institutional and program missions, priorities, and identities [5].\nThe history, context, and data about liberal arts CS curriculum design support the position that the\nliberal arts computing community is best supported by a process for working with curricular guidelines\nrather than a curriculum model or set of exemplars [5]. Previous work with ACM/IEEE curriculum\nguidelines over the decades has trended towards acknowledging that liberal arts CS curricula may take\na variety of forms and away from presenting a unified “liberal arts” model [6]. A review of liberal arts CS\nprograms demonstrates how institutional context, including institutional mission and structural factors,\nshape their curricula [5]. Survey data indicates that liberal arts programs have distinct identities or\nmissions, and this directly impacts curriculum and course design decisions. Programs prioritize flexible\npathways through their programs coupled with careful limits on required courses and lengths of\nprerequisite chains [6]. This can drive innovative course design where content from Knowledge Areas is\nblended rather than compartmentalized into distinct courses [7,8]. The CS curriculum is viewed as part\nof the larger institutional curriculum and the audience for CS courses is broader than just students in\nthe major, at both the introductory level and beyond.\nTo support the unique needs of CS liberal arts programs, we propose a process that guides programs\nto work with CS2023 through the lens of institutional and program missions and identities, goals,\npriorities, and situational factors. The Process Workbook we have developed comprises six major\nsteps:\n1. articulate institutional and program mission and identity;\n2. develop curricular design principles driven by program mission and identity, structural factors,\nand attention to diversity, equity, and inclusion;\n443\n3. identify aspirational learning outcomes in response to design principles and mission and\nidentity;\n4. engage with CS2023 to select curriculum and course content based on design principles to\nachieve learning outcomes and support mission and identity;\n5. evaluate the current program, with attention to current strengths, unmet goals, and opportunities\nfor improvement;\n6. design, implement, and assess changes to the curriculum.\nAn initial version of the Process Workbook, based on our research and feedback from workshops [9,\ne.g., 10,11] and pilot usage within individual departments, is available as a supplement to this article\n[12]. The authors will continue this iterative design process and release additional updates as we gather\nmore feedback. Future work includes development of a repository of examples of how programs have\nmade use of the Workbook to review and redesign their curricula in the light of CS2023.\nReferences\n[1] Kim B.

These colleges play a crucial role in fostering collaboration between\nstudents, workers, and institutions through educational and workforce initiatives. Over the past 50+\nyears, Community Colleges have served as a hub for various educational initiatives and partnerships\ninvolving K-12 schools, four-year colleges, and workforce/industry collaborations.\nThese colleges offer specialized programs that help students focus on specific educational pathways.\nAmong the programs available, computing-related courses are prominent, including Computer Science\ndegrees, particularly the Associate in Arts (AA) and Sciences (AS) degrees, known as academic\ntransfer degrees. These transfer degrees are designed to align with the ACM/IEEE curricular\nguidelines, primarily focusing on creating two-year programs that facilitate smooth transferability to four-\nyear colleges.\nFurthermore, the computing programs offered by Community Colleges are influenced by the specific\nneeds and aspirations of the regional workforce and industry. Advisory boards and committees play a\nsignificant role in shaping these programs by providing recommendations based on the demands of the\njob market. While the ACM Committee for Computing in Community Colleges (CCECC) and similar\nentities help address inquiries related to these transfer degrees, there is a desire to capture the\nchallenges, requirements, and recommendations from the Community College perspective in\ndeveloping general curricular guidelines.\nThis work presents the context and perspective of the community college education. It emphasizes the\nimportance of understanding the unique challenges faced by Community Colleges and their specific\nneeds while formulating curricular guidelines. Additionally, the work envisions considerations for the\nnext decade regarding curricular development and administrative efforts, considering the evolving\neducational landscape and industry demands.

While it is too early to\nconfidently predict how they will change computer science education, it is instructive to consider some\nof the ramifications already apparent. In this section, a few specific implications of generative AI are\nexplored by competency and knowledge areas. The overall observations follow.\n● Educators can use generative AI to create course syllabi, design projects and assignments, and\nautomate grading.\n● Students can use generative AI for individualized tutoring, undergraduate research, enhanced\nproductivity, etc. The skill set expected of students is changing, but the foundational knowledge\nthey need to know is not.\n● Tasks that are intellectually challenging, yet mechanical in nature will be automated. So,\nstudents must learn to work at higher levels of abstraction.\n● Issues of society, ethics, and the profession are taking on much more importance and\nsignificance and must not only be actively addressed in the curriculum, but also periodically\nrevisited and revised.\nImplications by Competency Area - Software\nAlgorithmic Foundations (AL)\n● The immediate impact of generative AI on Algorithmic Foundations is expected to be less than what\nis found in other knowledge areas since AL topics are primarily focused on students understanding\nthe foundations of algorithmic computation. As an example, while generative AI may be prompted to\nproduce an algorithmic solution utilizing less memory or improved runtime performance, students\nare expected to be able to evaluate the results of generative AI from an AL perspective of time-\nspace tradeoff and complexity analysis.\nFoundations of Programming Languages (FPL)\n● The next paradigm in programming might be conversational programming that involves providing\nappropriate prompts to help generative AI produce and test desired programs. Generative AI is also\nlikely to be able to translate code from one programming language to another, and from one\nparadigm to another. Program correctness proofs and validating program behavior against a\nspecification may also be areas in which generative AI makes advances because of the\nintellectually challenging, yet mechanical, nature of the process.\nSoftware Development Fundamentals (SDF)\n● While generative AI can write simple programs, the responsibility to verify the correctness of the\nprograms still falls on the user. So, even for verification purposes only, computer science students\nstill need to learn how to write programs. In order to provide appropriate prompts to generative AI,\nstudents need to be able to design and plan larger programs. How students design and write\n449\nprograms will evolve as generative AI technologies improve. How computer science educators must\nadapt to teaching programming with the help of generative AI is currently an open question. It\nseems likely that reading programs will see a sharpened focus and the idea of learning to program\nby writing, and reliance on learning syntax, will change towards learning to program by prompting,\ncomprehending, verifying, editing, modifying, adapting, and testing code. It is also likely that other\naspects of the curriculum such as problem decomposition will see increased focus.\nSoftware Engineering (SE)\n● Generative AI is expected to have substantial impact on several aspects of the software process,\nincluding (but not limited to) development of new code, comprehension of complex logging and\ndebugging artifacts, static analysis, and code reviewing. The most understandable and visible\nchange is likely to be in the development of (rote) new code—assistance technologies like GitHub's\nCopilot and other advanced auto-complete mechanisms can meaningfully improve development\ntime, to a point. Effective use of such tools requires a deeper investment in design and code\ncomprehension, while potentially decreasing the need for hands-on programming time. Similar\nadvances in static analysis and code review are anticipated to have a meaningful impact on code\nquality and clarity, ideally also reducing the impact of implicit bias by increasing consistency and\nquality of comments and diagnostics.\nImplications by Competency Area - Systems\nArchitecture and Organization (AR)\n● The evolution needed in computer architecture to better support generative AI technologies may\nitself become a critical area of study in the future. Another might be the impact of using generative\nAI for hardware design.\nData Management (DM)\n● Generative AI systems appear to excel at accomplishing intellectually challenging, yet mechanical\ntasks. It seems evident that given the expression of a query in pseudocode (or relational\nalgebra/calculus), the translation of a description of the desired query result into SQL will become a\nroutine generative AI task. In one sense, generative AI allows database querying at a higher\n(natural language, pseudocode) level. However, regardless of the level at which students query a\ndatabase, they will still need the skills to validate the results returned by an (AI-generated) SQL\nquery.\nNetworking and Communication (NC)\n● Generative AI technologies may be increasingly used in computer science education of networking\nand communications. For example, it can generate code for new or existing networking protocols,\nsuggestions for improvement, generate network traffic data for experimentation purposes, and\ngenerate scenarios for which a network architecture needs to be designed. Furthermore, it can\nverify whether networking requirements are ambiguous or complete. It can be used to automatically\n450\ngenerate configuration scripts, perform security assessments of existing networked configurations\nsuch as identifying vulnerabilities, and suggesting countermeasures, and perform reliability\nassessments and capacity planning.\nOperating Systems (OS)\n● Generative AI will be helpful with deployment scripts and system optimization. In the short term,\ngenerative AI will not invalidate the need for students to understand the layer between applications\nand the architecture. With that said, AI eventually will provide insight into the expected performance\nor security implications of software that is developer- or AI-generated. Students will need to\ncontinue to innovate and reason at higher-levels of abstraction.\nSystems Fundamentals (SF)\n● Providing system support for generative AI applications is expected to turn into a robust area of\nresearch and education.\nSecurity (SEC)\n● Generative AI can be used both by an adversary to launch more sophisticated attacks or develop\nmore dangerous malware and by the defender to protect against such attacks. Other issues in the\nimpact of generative AI on security include interaction between an AI attacker and defender,\nsecurity risks of data and reverse engineering AI models, AI-based data aggregation / phishing, and\nsecurity of AI systems themselves. Students need to develop a nuanced understanding of the\npower and drawbacks of generative AI applied to security concerns.\nImplications by Competency Area - Applications\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\n● The success of generative AI is already attracting more interest in Artificial Intelligence as a field,\nboth increasing the number of students interested in studying it and increasing its applicability to\nother subfields of computer science. Generative models provide opportunities to incorporate\nmultimodal analysis into larger pipelines and provide alternatives to techniques such as classical\nplanning (e.g., using an LLM to suggest next steps to solving a problem). However, they currently\nlack foundational guarantees of correctness, grounded perception, and explanation that are critical\nto many applications. Emerging techniques for combining subsymbolic and symbolic methods using\ngenerative models look promising for resolving these issues.\nGraphics and Interactive Techniques (GIT)\n● Intellectual property and ethical issues regarding the use of generative AI for 2D and 3D graphics,\nimages, video, and animation are important and evolving. These apply both to the media content\nand/or creative work used to train AI as well as the media created using generative AI.\n451\nHuman-Computer Interaction (HCI)\n● Generative AI will have a broad impact on the ways that people regard, and therefore interact, with\ncomputers and their output. Programs that employ generative AI can offer a simple interface that\nresponds to user prompts and rapidly produce acceptable output. Such products, however, require\nuser education to set reasonable expectations and acknowledge generative AI’s ability to err and to\nhallucinate. Users must also know how to engineer a prompt to achieve the desired effect. Ideally, a\nproduct that employs generative AI should have safeguards that evolve with their use and be\nadaptive for accuracy and sensitivity to the user's cultural norms. Finally, users should become\naware of issues surrounding intellectual property, transparency, and the extensive human labor\nrequired to train these models. The speed at which this technology continues to evolve requires\ncareful attention to both current and future potential pitfalls, failure modes, and human\nconsequences.\nSpecialized Platform Development (SPD)\n● From an educational standpoint, generative AI tools offer valuable assistance to both students and\ndevelopers. They enable the rapid creation of prototypes and the generation of code templates for\ncommon mobile app elements. Moreover, these tools produce code snippets for routine tasks,\nreducing the necessity for manual coding. This functionality is particularly advantageous for novices\nand those in the initial stages of learning mobile development. Generative AI Integrated\nDevelopment Environment (IDE) plugins also deliver real-time feedback and suggestions to\nstudents as they write code.\nFurthermore, generative AI enriches teaching by crafting interactive simulations and virtual\nenvironments tailored to mobile app development. These environments allow students to\nexperiment and hone their skills effectively. In the educational context, generative AI is crucial in\nraising awareness of security and ethical considerations within mobile app development.\nAdditionally, AI serves as an invaluable resource for developers by providing continuous updates on\nthe latest trends and technologies in specialized platform development, ensuring developers\nmaintain up-to-date skills and knowledge in this rapidly evolving field.\nImplications for Crosscutting Areas\nMathematical and Statistical Foundations (MSF)\n● Mathematics is learned best by “doing” with sustained practice in working through problems.\nAlthough generative AI tools may help in explaining, they are just as likely to present complete\nsolutions to students, robbing them of the learning gains that occur in struggling through problems.\nIn contrast, generative AI tools could be adapted to help instructors automate grading of proofs that\nwould alleviate what is now a laborious task. In the longer term, a balanced approach could offer\neducator support (automated grading) and student support through customized tutoring to address\nskill gaps either before starting a new course or while taking a course as long as the during-course\nusage is calibrated carefully. Perhaps the best option at the moment is to encourage rigorous on-\ngoing experimentation with generative AI so that the academic computing community can identify\nbest practices for the future.\n452\nSociety, Ethics, and the Profession (SEP)\n● The education computer science students receive needs to incorporate all dimensions and roles of\nthe computing profession: technical, philosophical, and ethical. Generative AI raises unique risks for\nSEP, for instance deepfakes and misinformation will become more pervasive and harder to identify.\nBeing technically capable of ethically questionable action and being technically able to identify and\nprevent such actions puts greater burden on SEP lessons to make students aware of these\nresponsibilities and ensure that as they enter the workforce as graduates, they work to keep society\non a just path.\nImplications for the Curriculum\n● It is clear that students must learn how to correctly use generative AI technologies for coursework.\nThe boundary between using generative AI as a resource and using it to plagiarize must be\nclarified. The limitations (e.g., hallucinations) of the technology must be discussed, as should the\ninherent biases that may have been baked into the technology by virtue of the data used to train\nthem.\n● Many new technologies have already redefined the boundary between tasks that can be\nmechanized and those that will need human participation. Generative AI is no different. Correctly\nidentifying the boundary will be the challenge for computer science educators going forward.\n● Generative AI may be used to facilitate undergraduate research – more innovative research by\nmore students at all levels of technical ability. Generative AI may be used by students for various\nresearch-related tasks: to fill the gaps in their understanding of prior research, build systems with\nwhich to test hypotheses, help interpret the results, etc.\n● Students may use generative AI to summarize assigned readings, help explain gaps in their\nunderstanding of course material, fill in gaps in the presentations of the classes they missed, and\ninteractively quiz themselves to assist in their studying.\n453\n454\nAcknowledgments\nOrganization\nThe following assisted the task force in its work:\n• ACM Staff:\no Yan Timanovsky, ACM Education & Professional Development Manager\no Lisa Kline, ACM Education and Professional Development Assistant\no John Otero, Site Selection\n• Jens Palsberg, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA, Chair of SIG Chairs\n• ACM Education Board\no Elizabeth Hawthorne, Rider University, Lawrenceville, NJ, USA\no Alison Derbenwick Miller, Consultant, formerly Oracle Inc.\no Christine Stephenson, Google Inc.
